He had another case (on behalf of \nPacific Gas & Electric<http://www.therecorder.com/id=1202764714611/Split-Verdict-in-PGE-Pipeline-Blast-\nCase?slreturn=20160712215338>) going to trial at the same time and couldn't convince U.S. District Judge \nJames Selna to push back the trial date, which had already been delayed several times. \nThis was the lay of the land: Two weeks before, the Los Angeles Times on May 8 had run a lengthy \nfeature<http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-infospan-lawsuit-20160508-story.html> that was distinctly \nsympathetic to the plaintiff, Farooq Bajwa. A former computer components manufacturer/ El Pollo Loco \nfranchise owner, his latest venture was a company called InfoSpan Inc. \nBajwa is portrayed as a visionary who had an idea to allow foreign workers to easily and cheaply send funds \nback to relatives in their home country via the internet or cell phone. \n\"I realized I might make a big difference in this world not only helping these underprivileged people who don't \nhave bank accounts, I will also be helping bring an economic revolution,\" Bajwa, 64, told the paper. \"I had \nvery big dreams.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012038 \nBut after he struck a deal with Emirates NBD to roll out his product, SpanCash, he claimed the bank stole his \nproprietary technology, killed the deal and ruined his company. (Though it's hard to feel too sorry for him--\nhe's pictured in front of his house, a mansion that would put Versailles to shame. In this David-and-Goliath \nstory, he's a David from the 1 percent.) \nBajwa sought $554 million plus punitive damages on trade secret misappropriation and misrepresentation \nclaims. \nTrial began on July 26 in U.S. District Court for Central District of California. On Aug. 10, Ruemmler and \nIsaacson summed up their opposing positions in closing arguments. \nLet's take a look. \nI Isaacson, who did not respond to a request for comment, led with one of his strongest cards: USA! USA! \n\"We as a country, made up of flawed people, come together as one of the greatest countries on Earth, because \nwe are a nation of laws,\" he said, according to a transcript of the proceedings. \"This was about hard work and \nwhat happens when your work is destroyed and taken, how you're entitled to be treated under the laws of the \nUnited States.\" \nFor Ruemmler, the appeal was not emotional or jingoistic. It was rational all the way. \nHer first line: \"Mr. Bajwa has come up with an interesting story, but it's not what happened.\" \nAnd then, in the most matter-of-fact, conversational way, she annihilated his case. \n\"There are at least five fatal flaws in Mr. Bajwa's case, and any one of those alone sinks his case. Any one,\" \nshe said, according to the transcript. \nBajwa couldn't prove that SpanCash was ever fully functional and commercially ready, Ruemmler said. In \nfact, she argued, it was never even a real product. \nFurther, she said, Bajwa didn't prove that the technology or platform was comprised of any trade secrets; or \nthat Emirates Bank stole SpanCash; or that it ever used it. Finally, Bajwa didn't prove InfoSpan suffered any \ndamages, she said. \nSome of her turns of phrase are refreshingly non-lawyerly. \"Sham is going down there... It's not as if these \nguys were exactly rubes...This is some flimflam thing... One of the many, many dog-ate-my-homework \nexcuses ....This is an absolute double-down lie.\" \nThe overall effect: she simplified without being condescending. \nBut there was still a hurdle for Emirates. Or as Latham's Schecter put it in an interview, \"There are some facts \nwe wouldn't script.\" \nAfter the bank terminated its agreement with InfoSpan and demanded its investment back, Infospan's deputy \nCEO, Larry Scudder, was arrested when he tried to leave the UAE. \n\"At the Dubai Airport that day, the Dubai police arrested Mr. Scudder after he presented his passport at an \nelectronic terminal. Police told Mr. Scudder that a charge of criminal fraud had been filed against him for \n$1,465,000. Mr. Scudder was handcuffed and marched through the airport and then held in police detention \nfacilities and interrogated,\" the complaint states. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012039 \nHe was handcuffed to a chair, then transferred to a cell with 30 people before being released 19 hours later, at \n1 am. And then, the police kept his passport for six months before he could finally leave the country. \nOn the stand, he cried when he spoke about the ordeal. \nIsaacson in his closing repeatedly called it extortion. \"Because when the bank held Mr. Scudder's passport--I'm \nsorry, caused his passport to held, that just didn't cause personal pain for Mr. Scudder,\" he said. \"What it did \nwas give the opportunity for the bank to control the technology, to control the situation, because now InfoSpan \ncouldn't compete in the UAE because of the fears that this type of thing would happen. And it also gave him \nthe opportunity to try and extort money and control of the technology from InfoSpan.\" \nHow do you counter that? \nRuemmler was not available for an interview, but Schecter said pretrial research showed people expect that if \nyou do business overseas, you'll comply with the laws of the foreign country. And in UAE, this is how they \nhandle fraud. \n\"Judge Selna has instructed you that filing a criminal complaint in Dubai for fraud is a common practice and \nthat if you've been cheated, that's what you're supposed to do,\" Ruemmler said. \nWhat about Scudder's emotional testimony? \nShe undercut it without coming across as callous--a fine line. \n\"Now, I have to mention the tears. And this is the only thing I'm going to say about it,\" Ruemmler said. \"He \nwas detained for less than 24 hours, nine years ago; and then, he was in his corporate apartment and had \n$300,000 to live for, like, about six months. I'm just going to say this: I will leave to you to evaluate the \nsincerity of those tears in light of all the other evidence that you have heard in this case.\" \nAnd then she immediately talked about how he \"basically, had faked a document.\" \nIt worked. After about a day of deliberation, the jury found across the board for Emirates NBD Bank. \n\"It was a binary case--either they lied or we lied,\" said Schecter. \"The plaintiff's strategy was all or nothing. \nThere were no off-ramps for the jury.\" \nThe Latham team also included counsel Andrew Fossum and associates Nima Mohebbi, Stephanie Grace, \nJonathan Sandler, Jacquelyn Levien, Elizabeth Greenman, Pushkal Mishra and Tom Rickeman. \nIn a statement to The Lit Daily, Lubna Qassim, chief group general counsel and company secretary of the \nEmirates NBD, said, \"While there was no basis for this case being tried in U.S. courts, Emirates NBD Bank is \ndeeply gratified by the jury's decision and appreciates the court's commitment to ensuring a fair trial.\" \nContact Jenna Greene at or on Twittergjgreenejenna. \nSent from my BlackBerry 10 smartphone. \nFrom: Schecter, Daniel (CC) \nSent: Saturday, August 13, 2016 1:34 PM \nTo: Pizzurro, Frank (LA); Dunlavey, Dean (OC); Mohebbi, Nima (LA); Ruemmler, Kathy (DC) \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012040 \nCc: #L&W BD PR (US); Wine, Jamie (NY); Bruno, Nicole (NY); Harris, Nicole (CH); Greenberg, Jeffrey \n(LA-NY); Bauer, Steve (SF-BR); Moore, Wendy (OC); Jennings, Alex (LA); Robins, Greg (LA) \nSubject: RE: Press: LA Times - Federal jury decides Middle East bank did not defraud Orange County \nentrepreneur \nOC Business Journal article with a nice shout out to Dean: \nhttp://www.ocbj .com/news/2016/aug/12/jury-decides-against-sjc-firm/ \nFrom: Pizzurro, Frank (LA) <i \nDate: Thursday, Aug 11, 2016, 7:41 PM \nTo: Dunlavey, Dean (OC) < >, \nSchecter, Daniel (CC) ________________________ ________ , Mohebbi, \nN >, Ruemmler, Kathy (DC) \n< » \nCc: #L&W BD PR (US) < <mailto:#______________________________ >, Wine, Jamie \n(NY) <>>, Bruno, Nicole (NY) \n< \n< \n< \n< \n< \n< \n< \nSubject: Press: LA Times - Federal jury decides Middle East bank did not defraud Orange County entrepreneur \n1>> \n>>, Harris, Nicole (CH) \n>>, Greenberg, Jeffrey (LA-NY) \n>, Bauer, Steve (SF-BR) \n>>, Moore, Wendy (OC) \n>, Jennings, Alex (LA) \n>, Robins, Greg (LA) \nThe LA Times appears to be the first media to report on the verdict. Latham references are highlighted: \nBUSINESS \nFederal jury decides Middle East bank did not defraud Orange County entrepreneur<http://fw.to/aXv1QHI> \n[Farooq Bajwa] \nFarooq Bajwa \nBy Andrew Khouri \nAugust 11, 2016 \nA federal jury decided Thursday that one of the Middle East's most prominent banks did not commit fraud and \nsteal technology from an Irvine firm that sued it for half a billion dollars in damages after their partnership \ncollapsed. \nOrange County company InfoSpan had alleged that Emirates NBD ended a partnership for a mobile payment \nsystem because it didn't want to share revenue and stole InfoSpan's technology to launch its own service. \nThe Dubai-based bank, in turn, denied it stole or ever used InfoSpan's technology. It argued that it cancelled \nthe partnership because InfoSpan couldn't produce a working product and misled it into thinking it was an \nestablished company, not one with little to no track record. \nAfter deliberating for a day, the jury unanimously decided that InfoSpan did not prove its case of fraud and \ntheft of trade secrets. \nInfoSpan had asked for $540 million in damages. An attorney for InfoSpan declined to comment on the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012041 \npossibility of an appeal. \nThe verdict capped a two-week trial that involved dueling accusations of fraud levied by high-profile attorneys \non both sides, including the former White House counsel to President Obama. \nAt the center of the high-stakes battle was San Juan Capistrano resident and entrepreneur Farooq Bajwa and a \nmobile payment system that he said would allow migrant workers in the Middle East to send remittances back \nhome through text messages. \nBajwa contended that InfoSpan, with support from outside investors, spent $87 million developing the \nbusiness and technology. \nTo launch the system, known as SpanCash, Bajwa partnered in 2007 with Emirates Bank, which is controlled \nby the United Arab Emirates' sovereign wealth fund. \nIt seemed the ideal collaboration for the Pakistani immigrant, who earned millions operating another Irvine \ncompany that manufactured computer components in the 1980s and 1990s \nThe Gulf States rely heavily on migrants to work construction and other low-wage jobs, offering a ready-made \nmarket for SpanCash. InfoSpan aimed to allow migrants to transfer money back home far more cheaply than \nWestern Union or hawala, a traditional Middle Eastern broker-to-broker money transfer system. \nA study from McKinsey & Co., cited in court records, projected annual revenue of $3.5 billion by the deal's \nfifth year, with InfoSpan receiving more than $2.8 billion in fees. \nBut the relationship between InfoSpan and Emirates Bank soured and the bank cancelled the deal in 2009. \nA few days later, Emirates filed a criminal complaint in Dubai against Bajwa and a partner alleging that they \ndefrauded the bank and misrepresented InfoSpan as an established business with a working technology. \nTwo years later, InfoSpan sued in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana and alleged that its technology was working \nand that it delivered its source code to the bank on servers. Emirates ended the deal, InfoSpan said, to launch \nits own mobile payment system after stealing InfoSpan's technology. \nIn court, an attorney for InfoSpan argued that Emirates torpedoed the InfoSpan relationship because it abhorred \nhow much money it would have to share with the Irvine firm. \n\"They wanted SpanCash and they wanted the money,\" attorney William A. Isaacson said in his closing \narguments Wednesday. \nIsaacson — a partner with powerhouse law firm Boies Schiller & Flexner, chaired by high-profile litigator \nDavid Boies — argued that the bank resorted to \"pure extortion\" in an attempt to get its way. \nAs a result of the bank's criminal complaint, InfoSpan alleged Bajwa's partner, Larry Scudder, was detained at \nthe Dubai International Airport and taken to a cell where he was locked in with 30 other men for 19 hours until \nhe secured his release by turning over his passport. \nAccording to the lawsuit, Bajwa tried to resolve the situation but was told Scudder's passport would be \nreleased and he could leave the country only if InfoSpan gave up ownership and control of SpanCash to the \nbank. \nSix months later, the bank withdrew the fraud accusations and Scudder got his passport back, but SpanCash's \nreputation was tarnished and it collapsed, Bajwa previously told The Times. \nThe bank disputed that it acquired InfoSpan's source code or used it at any time. \nFormer White House counsel and an attorney for the bank, Kathryn Ruemmler, said that Emirates never would \nhave acquired source code in a joint-partnership deal like the one reached with InfoSpan. She said such \ntechnology would instead be held by a third-party escrow company for the length of the partnership. \nIn her closing arguments, the partner with global firm Latham & Watkins told the jury that Bajwa and \nInfoSpan sold the bank a \"bill of goods,\" arguing that despite promises to Emirates, the technology never \nworked and InfoSpan wasn't as big a company as it claimed. \nThe bank cancelled the deal and filed a criminal complaint, not as a form of extortion but simply to regain the \nbank's money after it was misled and doubts grew about the character of InfoSpan's employees, Ruemmler \ntold the jury. \n\"They concluded, definitively, that they had been defrauded,\" she said. \nLubna Qassim, group general counsel for Emirates Bank, said in a statement after the verdict that \"Emirates \nBank is gratified by today's decision and the opportunity to receive a fair trial in U.S. courts.\" \nBajwa said the trial has taken a toll on him and he doesn't know his next steps. \n\"I am just beat up,\" he said. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012042 \nPhil Hirschkorn contributed to this report. \nCopyright 0 2016, Los Angeles Times<http://www.latimes.com/> \nFrank Pizzurro \nPublic Relations Senior Manager \nLATHAM & WATKINS LLP \n355 South Grand Avenue I Los Aneeles, CA 90071-1560 \nThis email may contain material that is confidential, privileged and/or attorney work product for the sole use of \nthe intended recipient.

Our financials sector specialist thinks XLF could have \nanother 20-25% upside given the many levers to the Trump Trade: less regulation, higher interest rates, higher vol, \neconomic growth, loan growth, etc. The asset sensitive regional banks are more of a pure play on a rates move but we \nview the larger cap banks as having multi-pronged upside given the aforementioned points. \nThat said, given the velocity and magnitude of the recent move and uncertainty around the impact and timing of \nTrump's policies, we believe options offer better risk-reward than being outright long financials stocks here.

In 2009, he purchased a 600-acre golf club along the Potomac \nRiver in Loudoun County and renamed it the Trump National Golf Club. He raised the ire of local environmentalists last \nsummer after the club removed hundreds of trees that it claimed threatened the shoreline. \nTrump's representative appeared at a foreclosure auction of Kluge's large estate on the courthouse steps in downtown \nCharlottesville Wednesday morning, where a crowd of about 50 lawyers and curiosity seekers had gathered. \nIn the past year, Kluge's travails have become well-known around Charlottesville, where over the last two decades the \nBritish-born socialite has cut a glamorous - and sometimes controversial - figure. \nIn 1999 she founded what became a well-respected vineyard on land around her grand house, which she had received as \npart of a high-profile divorce settlement in 1990 from John Kluge, the late media mogul who was once the country's richest \nman. \nKluge Estate Winery and Vineyard won accolades for sparkling wines - served at the White House and at Chelsea \nClinton's wedding last summer - and a blended red called New World Red. Kluge and her third husband, retired IBM \nexecutive William Moses, worked to promote not only their own wine brand but the growing Virginia wine industry as a \nwhole. \nBut in the past two years, following some aggressive expansion of the winery and the failure of the housing development, \nKluge fell upon hard times. Credit problems forced her to sell off her jewelry and extensive collection of art and antiques \nlast year. She lost the vineyard at a foreclosure auction in December. \nKluge had initially tried to sell Albemarle House - which the Sotheby's listing calls \"one of the most important residences in \nthe United States since the Golden Age\" - for $100 million, but when no buyer came forward the price was ultimately \nslashed to $24 million. The eight-bedroom home has its own movie theater, wine grotto, swimming pool and helipad. \nAt Wednesday's auction, Bank of America, Kluge's creditor, took full ownership of the property with a bid of $15.26 million. \nBut Trump holds what the lawyers called a \"right of first refusal\" to buy the property at a later date. \nKluge and Moses declined to comment directly on yesterday's events, but both have said they have been working \ndiligently with their lawyers over the last several months to help save their business. \nThe Trump organization had been working closely with Kluge and Moses on the deal, but how the partnership will play out \n- if they would have a future role at what would be Trump's vineyard - remained unclear Wednesday. \n\"They've been working together with the objective of trying to preserve the vineyard for the benefit of the Virginia wine \nindustry,\" Goldman said. \"If it all comes together, it may provide them an opportunity to continue to stay involved in their \nlife's work.\" \nYanda reported from Charlottesville. Staff researcher Magda Jean-Louis also contributed to this report. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012684 \n",

I have included the story in the body of the e-mail as well. \nThanks, \nStephanie \nOmar Quadhafi is hunkering down in Tripoli giving press interviews denying that rebels are taking over \nEastern Libya. Oil prices are shooting over one hundred dollars a barrel. The US government is on the \nverge of a shut down. These are not the top secret opening lines to Aaron Sorkin's new script, but the \nglobal headlines of a world spinning out of control. I head to Los Angeles like an overdressed lemming to \nattend the 83rd Academy Awards and attempt to make sense of artists thrust into combat. \nFor the second year nearly 6,000 Academy members have nominated 10 films and the battle is down to two. \nThe beloved timeless classic, \"The King's Speech\" marches into the arena as the front runner, but \npassionate supporters of the brilliant edgier (and critics darling) \"The Social Network\" have not \nconceded. The ballots are counted, the party invites are out and still the feelings are raw. Filmmakers \nare exhausted from campaigning. \nAt Bryan Lourd's famous star studded party Sony Classics' Co-President Michael Barker announces to me he \nhas taken a random sampling of voters in the room. He says, \"There will be a 'Social Network' upset at \nthe Kodak Theater.\" Shear panic radiates from my every pore as he says, \"I am joking.\" It's like color \nwar at summer camp. \nWoody Allen and George Lucas tell me they are no longer members of the Academy because pitting artists \nagainst each other to determine the quality of their work is insane. They are right. \nMy event and publicity company is considered \"Switzerland\" by the studios, as we help every filmmaker to \npresent and position his work. This year I am somewhat emotionally sucked in. \nIn 2005 I meet the unknown 32-year-old English director Tom Hooper on his first film for HBO,\"Elizabeth \nI\". The Emmy award winning movie stars Helen Mirren, who takes credit for discovering him directing \nEnglish television. Helen later wins her Oscar for portraying Queen Elizabeth in \"The Queen\". Queen \nElizabeth is the daughter of King George VI portrayed by Oscar winner Colin Firth in \"The King's Speech\". \nI also become Hooper's champion encouraging many to see his early work including his herculean 10 hour \nHBO mini-series \"John Adams\" produced by Tom Hanks. \nSix years later at the Telluride Film Festival Tom Hooper is bathing in the glory of a hysterical \nstanding ovation with Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush at the very first screening of \"The King's Speech.\" \nSurprisingly, this drama's subtle humor gets big laughs leading up to its emotional ending. \nWithin two weeks, at The Toronto Film Festival, Harvey Weinstein is now standing with his filmmakers \nwitnessing the same reaction. The film wins The Audience Prize. Their strategy is to say nothing. Do \nnothing. They have a possible Oscar winner. Four out of five past Best Pictures have premiered in \nToronto. \nCut to New York City at the end of September. It's the opening night at The Film Society of Lincoln \nCenter. One of America's most important and prolific producers Scott Rudin, along with Jesse Eisenberg, \nAndrew Garfield and Aaron Sorkin are in a brightly lit box waving down to their equally hysterical \naudience who have just seen \"The Social Network\". \nThe film opens the next day to rave reviews and endless publicity. David Fincher is off making \"The Girl \nwith the Dragon Tattoo\". Aaron Sorkin becomes the face of the film and an immediate shoo-in for an Oscar. \nThe Hamptons International Film Festival in October suddenly becomes a launching pad for \"127 Hours\", \nwhere cool Yale/NYU student James Franco appears and receives a heroic standing ovation. More Oscar buzz. \n\"Black Swan\" also unspools there in a tiny theater as Madonna, Alec Baldwin and even Harvey Weinstein \nslip in the back. Darren Aronofsky, sporting the ever present cool wool scarf around his neck is hailed a \ngenius. Natalie Portman is instantly the hot nominee for Best Actress. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012685 \nBoth films are sensational and movie goers go nuts, but it is \"The King's Speech\" that edges out the \ncompetition for The Audience Prize. \nMid-November David O. Russell and Mark Wahlberg, working together for the third time, sneak \"The Fighter\" \nin Manhattan. As their audience erupts in cheers, I tell producer/actor Wahlberg, \"Clint Eastwood is \ngoing to kill himself for not directing this.\" Wahlberg says, \"You are wrong. He turned it down because \nhe's done it. He has seen it and he loves it.\" I instantly lavish my affection and praise on David O. \nRussell, who becomes my new Clint Eastwood. Christian Bale and Melissa Leo are hailed the supporting \nactors to beat. \n\"True Grit\" directed by the Coen Brothers and also produced by Scott Rudin doesn't premiere till mid-\nDecember at the Ziegfeld as the last serious Oscar contender for Best Picture. It gallops off to box \noffice gold. \nThis is the year many of the 78 million Baby Boomers go back to the theaters. Five small budget \nindependent films become surprise hits as each exceeds $100 million \n\"The Social Network\" now cements its battle cry with one word; \"relevance\". Mark Zuckerberg lands on the \ncover of Time Magazine as The Person of the Year. A smart and extensive ad campaign positions the film in \nthe lead. Critics and pundits proclaim the race is over. \"The Social Network\" is the clear winner. \nEveryone goes on holiday. \nThis is probably the only time in Harvey Weinstein's life that he is caught off guard. He quickly \nmobilizes an inner team of 15 and conducts strategy meetings 7 days a week, including Christmas. They \nbecome like a Chinese Restaurant...always open. A generational war is in full swing. Harvey screens his \nfilm for the older voters. Everything is done by the books. Budgets are limited. He sends screenwriter \nDavid Seidler and Tom H000per to every corner of the country doing q+a's till they are blue in the face \nfrom \"finding their voice.\" SAG voters begin seeing the film 2 and 3 times. \nIn January the Golden Globes voted on by about 88 foreign journalists gives Best Drama to \"The Social \nNetwork\", Best Director to David Fincher and Best Screenplay to Aaron Sorkin. Their film is still \nperceived as the Oscar winner. \nTeam Weinstein underestimates their hard work and is in shock when \"The King's Speech\" wins the PGA in \nL.A. Harvey doesn't even attend and is working in Sundance. They are equally surprised when Tom Hooper \nwins the DGA and the actors win the SAG Ensemble. The BAFTAs reinforced the lead. They are now the front \nrunner. It takes the media a few weeks to catch on. \nThe Daily Mail announces Her Royal Highness, Queen Elizabeth has enjoyed a private screening of \"The \nKing's Speech\" and is \"moved\" by the film. With no proof the Queen has actually seen the film, the \nWeinstein Company sends out a global press release thanking her Majesty for the endorsement. They also \nacknowledge Prime Minister David Cameron's private Christmas screening. \nOn Oscar night, it isn't until Hilary Swank surprisingly yells out Hooper's name for Best Director that \nHarvey's gang finally realizes they are getting the Oscar for Best Picture. The King has spoken. \nFriday, February 24th \nMid-day, I arrive at The Beverly Hills Hotel, where I have stayed for thirty years. As the housekeepers \nunpack my bags upstairs I peek into the Polo Lounge and find icon Warren Beatty in a booth. He motions me \nover to meet an Egyptian fashion editor from Cairo. I say, \"Warren, you are a little late to visit \nCairo.\" I tell him I'm rooting for Annette and love her film \"The Kids Are All Right\". Warren tells me \n\"The Social Network\" will win. \nThis year I am two days late arriving to Oscar weekend. I am now shown to a very very very small room, \nthe size of a broom closet. Uncharacteristically, I have a slight melt down. I am moved. The housekeepers \nrun down the hall with my clothes flying. I calm down. The hotel is sold out. I get someone else's room. \nAnother poor schmuck checking in downstairs will get the broom closet. \nIt is cold, grey and rainy. Taffata, organdy and embroidered silk evening clothes hang in my closet. I \nstay in my sweaters and fur coat and head to Arianna Huffington's Mediterranean house in Beverly Hills \nwhere Wendi Murdoch and Arianna are hosting a party for Tom Freston's wife, the beautiful blond Kathy. \nThe book is called \"Veganist: Lose Weight, Get Healthy, Change the World. A perfect book for Monks. \nArianna has just sold the Huffington Post for to AOL to $315 million dollars and rumored to have \npersonally landed around $20 million. She is euphoric as she greets Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban at the \ndoor. Other drenched power players ushered in under umbrellas include Disney's Bob Iger and wife Willow \nBay, Fox's Jim Gianopulos, Candice Bergen and journalist daughter Chloe Malle, Google's Eric Schmidt, \nOliver Stone avoiding questions about Charlie Sheen and escorting his daughter Tara, Moby, Jamie Niven, \nBrian Grazer, Vivi Nevo, Tracey Ullman, CBS's Les Moonves and Julie Chen, Rob Reiner, Paramount's Brad \nGrey and fiancé Cassandra Marc and Jeff Bezos. Hors d'oeuvres include pigs in blankets, a food group not \nmentioned in Kathy's book. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012686 \nThe party action migrates to UTA Jim Burkus's home in the neighborhood for \"True Grit's\" Ethan and Joel \nCoen. I pass Ron Howard on the way in and he says, \"Keep me on your list.\" Is he kidding? Sunrise and \nMark Ruffalo, Tim Robbins, Focus Feature's James Shamus, Nancy Meyers and John Goldwyn mingle. Adorable \nHallie Steinfeld is there with her parents. I am trying to fix her up with Justin Bieber. She giggles, \n\"Peg, I am only 14.\" \nHunky Josh Brolin tells me he is coming to New York in March to shoot two new films. He is working on \nproducing and starring in \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" with Tim Burton as a future project. \nI am now inches away, face to face with Harrison Ford and stupidly tell him I love him in \"Morning \nGlory\". He is looking at me in utter disbelief and I will not shut up. A gorgeous guy is also inches away \nin a hat, glasses, jacket, layered sweater and scarves. I whisper to Harrison, \"That looks just like \nJohnny Depp.\" Harrison rolls his eyes and reluctantly introduces me to his friend Johnny Depp. I babel a \nbit about his great work and run for cover to a corner next to my buddy, Jerry Bruckheimer. Jerry \nintroduces me to the wives, Vanessa Paradis and Calista Flockhart I bore them with girly chit-chat and \nrealize it's time to get out of there. \nI head over to the CAA/Bryan Lourd \"Friday Night Party\". Torrential rains and horrific winds cause a \ntraffic jam that makes it impossible to get near the house. Cell phones do not work. The world's most \nfamous faces cower under black umbrellas and make a run for it. \nBryan Lourd and Bruce Bozzi receive friends at the door all night. Inside Uma tells me she finally moved \ninto a doorman building in New York after being terrorized by stalkers for years. Talented, Ben Walker \ntalks about \"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\" he is about to shoot as his fiancé Mamie Gummer looks sexy \nshivering in a white satin gown. Producer Jon Kilik mentions he oversees a new cut of Julian Schnabel's \n\"Miral\" to be released in March. Bennett Miller, standing with Kristin Gore says Sony loves his new film \n\"Moneyball\" and Brad Pitt is terrific. (When is Brad Pitt not terrific?) Sandy Gallin tells me he has an \nactual job decorating Jeffrey Katzenberg's home and he has never been happier. I congratulate Barry \nLevinson's son, Sam, a director, for winning the writing award at Sundance for his first film, \"Another \nHappy Day\" which is inspired by his family. \nAlso seen floating around are, Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal, but not together, Sean Penn, Tom Curise \nand Katie Holmes, Anderson Cooper, Hilary Swank, Kelly Ripa, Carrie Fisher, Bruce Weber, Sean Combs, Paul \nHaggis, Marisa Tomei, Jay Roach, Kate Beckinsale, Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher, Kate Hudson, Gerard \nButler, Leo DiCaprio and Bar Refaeli, Renee Zellweger with Bradley Cooper, Biutiful director Alejandro \nGonzalez-Inarritu, Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, Ellen Barkin who is headed to Broadway in \"The Normal \nHeart\" this spring and CAA's Kevin Huvane, Richard Lovett and Hylda Queally. \nBusy Bruce Cohen who is producing Sunday's awards broadcast tries to get his car to leave. Limo lock is \nat a standstill. Nothing is moving outside. Two hundred swells become party prisoners and resign to just \nhaving an absolute ball till 5:00am. Once again, this is the most star studded party in town. \nSaturday, February 26th, 2011 \nThe sun comes up and dries up all the land. IAC chairmen and owner of The Newsweek/Daily Beast Barry \nDiller and his designer wife Diane Von Furstenberg host their annual lunch for Graydon Carter in their \nColdwater Canyon home. Barry introduces me to his star guest, Governor Jerry Brown, just elected to his \nthird (nonconsecutive) term as California Governor. Diane's children, Alex and Tatiana, along with their \nchildren comprise three generations of guests, which makes this party so special. \nLike last year, enormous clear plastic tents are erected on the hill near the house. Long wooden picnic \ntables covered with yellow flowers sit on oriental rugs, covering the soggy ground. Terrines of hot soup, \nplatters of sausages, fried chicken and salads are beautifully arranged on an endless buffet. Everyone \nwears winter clothes; comfy sweaters and sensible shoes. I arrive in a fur coat. \nBarry and Diane's loyal friends have been coming to this party for over fifteen years. Everybody knows \neverybody and it doesn't matter if you have a hit film or TV show this season. Oprah Winfrey kisses David \nGeffen, casually chats with former Disney CEO Michael Eisner and current Sony chief Sir Howard Stringer. \nBrett Ratner arrives with his house guest Jean Pigozzi who is allowed to photograph everyone. Graydon \ngreets people with wife Anna and Fran Lebowitz by his side. \nIngrid Sischy and Sandy Brant, Rupert Murdoch, Ron Meyer, Bryan Lourd Francesco Clemente with his twin \nboys and Tom Ford chat each other up. People watching include the pregnant Victoria and David Beckham \nwith Lynn Wyatt, Liv Tyler, Vincent Gallo, Eva Longoria, Larry Gagosian and Shala Monroque, Ben \nSilverman, Debbie and Allen Grubman, Tobias Meyer and Mark Fletcher and Stephen Gaghan and Mini Mortimer \nwearing her oversized cat glasses. \nBruce Cohen has invited me to the Oscar broadcast rehearsal. This is a special honor. There are metal \nbarricades leading up to the credentials trailer. High-tech security includes photos and computer \nbackground checks. The only thing they don't do is pat me down and ask for fingerprints. Once inside the \nKodak Theater's massive auditorium, I find a seat next to Bruce's proud parents. I watch Josh Brolin and \nJavier Bardem come out in white dinner jackets and flub their lines as they pretend to present Best \nAdapted Screenplay and Best Original Screenplay. Josh later told me at The Night Before Party that their \nacting methods are completely opposite. Josh says he is a quick study and is very creative and \ncomfortable ad-libbing. Javier, whose mother tongue is Spanish, needs to have every syllable printed out, \nwhich he studies with a dialect coach. Little wiggle room for jokes. Life size photos on large cardboard \nplaques are taped to each nominee's chair. I try to memorize their location, so when I return Sunday I \ncan quickly kiss them all. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012687 \nBack at the Beverly Hills hotel, I slip into my gorgeous black tulle Dennis Basso cocktail dress with a \nplunging neck line and put on my mother's jewels. Jim Coleman takes me the Night Before Party in the \nhotel. This is Jeffrey Katzenberg's, 9th Annual A-lister event benefiting The Motion Picture & Television \nFund where they raise $6.5 million dollars in one night. I walk right into Valentino who gives me the \nonce over and approves my outfit. I tell him and Giancarlo Giammetti that Woody Allen's new film, \n\"Midnight in Paris\" is opening the Cannes Film Festival and they must bring the yacht. Woody is also \nfilming all summer in Rome and I am counting on them to entertain him. \nElton John and David Furnish join our conversation and of course we ask for intimate details about the \nnew baby. Elton says this is the first time they have been away from him for more than a night and they \nare delirious with parenthood. I segway over to Amy Adams who mentions she also hates leaving her baby in \nthe hotel room. I tell her she's acted like a lady with all the attention showered on Melissa Leo and \nthat someday soon she will win an Oscar because she consistently hands in amazing performances and \neverybody loves her. Next stop is Kate Capshaw in a black bowler hat chatting with Steven Spielberg's \ngod-daughter Gwyneth Paltrow. Kate gushes as she talks about her two grandchildren from daughter Jessica. \nI have known Steven since \"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\". In 1982, as a young publicist on \"E.T.\" I moved to \nCalifornia to work for him as one of his thirteen assistants. I now tell him I'm going to Broadway \nopening of \"War Horse\" with Kathy Kennedy and Frank Marshall and cannot wait to see his movie version. He \nis wildly excited about the film. I beg him to work on it. \nI meet sweet Jennifer Aniston, her new hair cut and her perfect little body. Her date tells me her secret \nis a half hour on the treadmill every day. Somehow I think that's an understatement. I tell Jesse \nEisenberg I was on his plane home from the Baftas last week. He was hiding under his hoodie and I knew \nnot to bother him. He said innocently, \"You should have said 'Hello'. I always cover my head because I \nthink my curls make me look like a girl\". \nThe charity gives us a coupon booklet redeemable at various booths for cheap clothing, new iPads, make-\nup, chocolates, shampoo and a $50 dollar Arch gift card for free McDonalds hamburgers. A bargain is a \nbargain, rich people run around like lunatics, collecting gifts for their housekeepers. Among the \nshoppers are Steven and Heather Mnuchin, Viacom's Deborah and Philippe Dauman, Tamara Mellon, Christine \nTaylor and Ben Stiller, Cate Blanchette, Susan and Robert Downey,Jr., and Debra and Hugh Jackman. \nNext stop is The Weinstein Company's Pre-Oscar party at the Soho House, sponsored by MontBlanc, \ncelebrating their new charity partnership and $1 million dollar donation to the Princess Grace \nFoundation-USA. Long gone are the funky Miramax Saturday night parties where nominees spoofed their own \nfilms in homemade costumes and ad-libbed hilarious skits. Grown men would dress as Anna Paquin and play \nthe piano in hopes of winning a Max Award. \nThere is social anxiety at the Soho House garage entrance. Guests patiently wait as super stars whisk by. \nA four hundred pound gorilla refuses to let me on the elevator until I spot Benny Medina. Once on, I see \nthe radiant Jennifer Lopez in the corner and remind her we met on Len Blavatnik's yacht in Cannes. She \ngraciously pretends to know me. Her manager, Benny Medina is kicking me. \nI slip into Colin Firth's booth by the front bar to have a tete-a-tete with him and his wife Livia \nGiuggioli about tomorrow night. Jokingly, I suggest when he wins to say, \"I'm speechless\". Colin \npatiently assures me many people, far more clever than I, have already mentioned this. He then says that \nothers are waging bets on whether he might subconsciously stutter. I grill him about his wardrobe, \nassuming he will be wearing a new Tom Ford tuxedo. He tells me both he and Ford will be in older models \nas Ford only designs classics. I tell him I made director Charles Ferguson, front runner for the \nfinancial documentary \"Inside Job\" spend $6,000 dollars last week for a new Tom Ford tuxedo. \nIn the back room Jennifer Lopez is now seated with Weinstein's wife Georgina Chapman. Nominee Helena \nBonham Carter, her husband Tim Burton and her mother Elena circulate. Celebs have now drifted over from \nThe Night Before Party. The star power includes Adrien Brody, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Cameron Diaz, \nCamilla Belle, Chace Crawford, Claire Danes and Hugh Dancy, Darren Aronofsky, Emma Stone, Jaime Foxx, \ndirector John Wells, Kerry Washington, Piers Morgan, Rachel Zoe, Russell Simmons, Sean Parker, Sir Ben \nKingsly, Zack Braff , Michelle Williams and Leonardo Dicaprio with Bar Rafaeli. \"Speech\" filmmakers are \nfunctioning on high anxiety. \nSunday, February 27th, 2011 \nProducer Donna Gigliotti is my date to the awards. We are both so nervous we arrive at the Kodak Theater \nat 3:00pm and nobody is there. We are driven around for an hour. When we arrive at the world's most \nfamous red carpet, I guide Donna through the extreme right security check-in to make sure we mingle with \nthe nominees and get on camera. I teach her the red carpet hustle which is five steps forward, three \nsteps back and one inch behind a couture-clad nominee. We greet Bryan Lourd as Sandra Bullock is talking \nto ABC-TV and a billion people see me wearing a black Marchesa gown. Five steps forward, three steps \nback, we next meet Gwyneth Paltrow. As I hook up the back of her dress another billion people see us \ncorrecting a fashion malfunction. Once again, five steps forward and three steps back. We are now posing \nfor the still cameras between Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban. Our handbags begin buzzing. Countless \nfriends are e-mailing us that they just saw us on television. \nJames Franco and Anne Hathaway are hip and energetic hosts. The film montages are always the best and the \nset looks great. This is the year of no surprises. Sorkin, Seidler, Christian Bale, Melissa Leo, Natalie \nPortman and Colin Firth are totally prepared to receive the gold. Tom Hooper's win leads into Best \nPicture. Harvey is now sitting in Spielberg's seats as Spielberg announces the win. Six months of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012688 \ngrueling work have finally paid off. King George VI and Harvey Weinstein now share the journey of a \nsingle man who triumphs over adversity. \nThe Governor's ball, held above the Kodak Theater, recreates the Mocambo-Ciro's niteries of the 1930's \nand 40's, using a palette of teal and white. Three bands alternate musical styles as hungry guests wolf \ndown Wolfgang Puck's delicious food. The winners triumphantly sachet around the room holding their heavy \neight pound gold statues. \nAn hour later there is a migration to the famous Vanity Fair party hosted by Graydon Carter at the Sunset \nTower Hotel owned by Jeff Klein. One celebrity after another poses in front of the green hedge standing \nin the middle of the circular Vanity Fair logo to record their devotion and support to Graydon and the \nmagazine. \nThere's a hierarchy of arrival times. The inner circle of Graydon's 150 best friends attend a seated \ndinner and viewing of the show at 5pm. They include Barry Diller and Diane Von Furstenberg, Francis Ford \nCoppola, Jon Hamm and Jennifer Westfeldt, Betsey Bloomingdale, Tory Burch and Lyor Cohen, Tom Ford, Sandy \nGallin, Mitch Glazer and Kelly Lynch, Carolina and Reinaldo Herrera, L'Wren Scott and Sir Mick Jagger, \nNaomi Watts and Live Schreiber, Wendi Stark, Judd Apatow, Jackie and Joan Collins, George Hammilton, \nDonna Karan and Steve Martin. \nThe best and the brightest talent in town arrive at 9pm. They are Justin Bieber and his date Selena \nGomez, Andrew Garfield, Jude Law, Vera Farmiga, Armie Hammer, Jennifer Lawrence, Kevin Spacey, Charlize \nTheron, Anne Hathaway, Hailee Steinfield,Taylor Hackford and Helen Mirren, Scarlett Johansson, Michelle \nWilliams, Isla Fischer and Sasha Baron Cohen, Jane Fonda after her play, \"33 Variations\", Melania and \nDonald Trump whom I introduce to David 0. Russell as The Trumpster gushes about \"The Fighter\". Donald \noffers me a ride home on his plane. He is leaving in ten minutes. Too bad James Franco didn't know \nbecause he is presently sitting on a commercial flight back to school, skipping his own after party. \nSocial standings of the rest of the guests are determined by half hour increments. Every other person \npreviously mentioned in the story is here. VF's Beth Kseniak and Matt Ullian tell me the list is cut down \nto 800 this year. \nAt 11:30pm there is another celebrity migration up the hill to Madonna manager Guy Oseary's house. One \nshould note that earlier in the evening Madonna came down the hill to pose in a risque outfit with \ndaughter Lourdes in front of the green hedge. Madonna and co-host Demi Moore are able to lure the creme \nde la creme with the promise of fabulous music, dancing and no cameras. Those reported on their dance \nfloor include Ryan Phillippe with Amanda Syedfried, who were making out all night and Phillippe's ex-wife \nReese Witherspoon and new fiancé Jim Toth. They pregnant Natalie Portman and choreographer Benjamin \nMillepied, Mick Jagger, Tom Hanks, Sean Penn, Ralph Feinnes, Mila Kunis, Cameron Diaz, Gwyneth Paltrow \nand Renee Zellweger and Bradley Cooper boogie til dawn. \nA winner's work is never done. Colin Firth, Tom Hooper and David Seidler show up at 4:30am at The Four \nSeasons Hotel for a live broadcast on The Today Show with Meredith Vieira. Functioning on an adrenalin \nrush, they are back at the Kodak Theater with Geoffrey Rush to appear on Oprah's live broadcast. Leave it \nto Oprah to get the king's last words. \n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Peggy Siegal \nSent: Friday, March 04, 2011 6:12 PM \nTo: Stephanie \nSubject: Oscar diary \nSend to jeffrey \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012689 \n",

The \"new\" is the Dream Downtown NYC, a hip, reinvented space at the crossroads of Chelsea and the Meatpacking District (MePa, if you really must). The \"noteworthy\" is a little thing called skydiving at Mount Everest. Whether it's lounging poolside in New York or jumping out of a plane in full view of the world's highest mountain, there's a lot going on this week. Read on for all the details, including properties in Paris, San Francisco, Vegas, Miami and more. (Image: Skydive Mount Everest - on sale Sat, Aug 6.) \n\n \n\t\n\t \n \n\t\n\t\nHip Manhattan Newcomer... with Real Sand\n\n \n <http://cdn.jetsetter.com/static/templates/mktg/lt-gray-pixel.gif> \n \n\nDream Downtown - NYC\n\n \n <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=b729e29fef3ecc26669f0079f97f4b05246b2e0bd645fcdcbb33823945d94c9dbc460605a6f14795>  \n \n\t\n\tThe new Dream Downtown has the best of both worlds. Housed in a 1960s building designed by Albert C. Ledner, it's situated at the crux of Manhattan's art, design and nightlife scenes between Chelsea and the Meatpacking District.

Family-friendly and super flexible, this is a true South African safari vacation, complete with personal cooks, butlers and animal trackers at your service. \n \n\nClick here to preview sale <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=c53ef1c444ca5bde99e6955cbdb470af6ae666253bedb3d35d55eadd32ce06d2d2fb369e19410a54>   \t \nStarting Saturday 6/8 at 5pm BST\n\n \n <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=c53ef1c444ca5bde8194dfafaf2c13edc97148fd94f7c8fb37a5471b045f29a1e2bfffd93361de54>  \n \n\t\n\t\t\t\n\t <http://cdn.jetsetter.com/static/templates/mktg/10px_lt-gray-pixel.gif> \n \n\t\n\t \n\nSales this week\n\n \n\nStarting Today at 8pm BST\n\nMamaison Hotel Budapest <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=c53ef1c444ca5bde033f2e63dd4387648bbff1f7e625e2a4f18c0cd4ef00344c76b7b613d9eacee3> \nSofitel Montreal Golden Mile <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=c53ef1c444ca5bde6d4bdafbe96a3410c16bcc691117341f111e0c15570272d84ec22df5d992567f> \nCervo - Switzerland <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=c53ef1c444ca5bde85c979c4f03c50486f3b426940bbf6e3a84d23071b5039a1fc710f1ab1b2a0e7> \n\nStarting Thursday at 8pm BST\n\nThe Shores - Daytona Beach <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=c53ef1c444ca5bde4d982861ec03fb54320b1ed28ab6d617f493316ae9ca48068a42a24c1b3ecc52> \nThe Raleigh - South Beach <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=c53ef1c444ca5bdee3fe2ee8b818e32105b6307cca05760d204bf4ba568b4e8983ebc214bffe65f5> \nShorebreak - California <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=c53ef1c444ca5bdea824ed6dbfb84fc3e74eec2295c9c69d517230c496416ffe91a4fa8742ce2f60> \n\nStarting Friday at 5pm BST\n\nVeranda House - Nantucket <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=c53ef1c444ca5bded929246a16e4ca4acaa5c936c4146d911c2b4779760af131787e4fc3286177cd> \n\n\t \n\t\n\nStarting Friday at 8pm BST\n\nIron Horse Hotel - Milwaukee <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=dfc9cda88665de96c9f84ae45deed9448f145436febd6f56c7bfbef8d05d86dfe26e78c9fff436d5> \nHidden Pond - Maine <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=dfc9cda88665de96c4e721dfeccc43a8e756f6171e562b36569d2f6756c8c50b18d1d2bd6599c9c5> \nKedron Valley Inn - Vermont <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=dfc9cda88665de969f9489bb363e8c30f9e9619bd631f56215b3ab3f6755872c76fd9a41d6d85829> \n\nStarting Saturday at 5pm BST\n\nA Culinary Retreat in Mexico <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=dfc9cda88665de961d6910d0351621d06d9f0f162a58b67a3717ae3f817fc1095e6dbd41178845dc> \nMorukuru - South Africa <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=dfc9cda88665de96c9c64c55ecc666e813ee274200ab3e10e4d4521a2004eb275c78763d01529f6b> \nSkydive Mount Everest <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=dfc9cda88665de96cbf04b8932a1db9a69e588217d21566f4d928f2a34cfa4b7fb1cb8421e0f3d01> \n\nStarting Sunday at 5pm BST\n\nThe Alexandra - Turks & Caicos <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=dfc9cda88665de968d6bb0ee96331d5982f5a844cd136b300bf7780943276e46ae3cb404d3215e19> \n\n\t \n\t\n\nStarting Sunday at 8pm BST\n\nLas Alamandas - Mexico <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=dfc9cda88665de966eb9e98b0622500c8605e131b5bade1f24ec6823e4070db8c6b601def89f54c2> \nArenas del Mar Beachfront <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=dfc9cda88665de968fae665f36e3e2750a3170de02d5c3d616298ac31eb64c7fe396499ea1351aa2> \nBlue Waters - Antigua <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=dfc9cda88665de9641e4ee501578bb5d5d13115552714a062ec502ffec52cb08b13959b8e93de0bb> \nNayara Hotel, Spa & Gardens <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=aacd9f741a61650ab71459c4b4bc25c2eb48f9ee7e9a789884be2a478beaf7ab5ee36a3d88226600> \n\nStarting Monday at 8pm BST\n\nHotel Matilda - San Miguel <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=aacd9f741a61650ab541cd0ecfea08a384ae0068d3ef207040473f2fb0b84514eaa97116ff4e4dff> \nSanta Teresa - Rio De Janeiro <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=aacd9f741a61650a82f3067333fb5b4f686d004e412b8a1b776282abf29cab1896355740e14527e7> \n\n \n\t\n <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=b729e29fef3ecc26ca27aa5e0f6c483a2975d166ae2aa100747db46bc90cc94cc911d834590623ca> \t \n\t\nTo make sure this goes to your inbox, just add ASMALLWORLD@travel.asmallworld.net <mailto:ASMALLWORLD@travel.asmallworld.net>  to your address book.\nContact us at travel@asmallworld.net <mailto:travel@asmallworld.net> , on Twitter at @AskJetsetter <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=aacd9f741a61650aaffe884f32750dbf9e5fc8af946aa94ccb82b4d8f5433842dacfe4d174006ea1> , or call us at 877-JSET-USA/877-573-8872.\nJetsetter, 40 W 20th Street Floor 7, New York, NY, 10011\nTo unsubscribe from ASW Travel Deals email advertisements, please click here <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=aacd9f741a61650a961a1b7dc915de6b6fac627f858f93a1d45177d78d4f1755569d0f231526428e> . \n\n\t\n <http://click.mail.jetsetter.com/?qs=b729e29fef3ecc26ca27aa5e0f6c483a2975d166ae2aa100747db46bc90cc94cc911d834590623ca> \t \t\n",

As a result, he is required to register as a sex offender. While \nhe wasn't prosecuted for additional charges, more than 40 girls under the age of 18 say they \ncame to his home and gave him massages. During the massages, they say, he masturbated \nand sexually assaulted them. \nBrad Edwards and Paul Cassell, attorneys representing two of his alleged victims, say in \nthe filing that the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of Florida of deliberately \nmisled the victims by telling them there was an ongoing investigation into their claims. \nHowever, they say, the office was concealing the fact that they already had signed a \n-osecution deal with Epstein. \n-ding to the motion, the U.S. Attorney's office in January 2008 and May 2008 sent \"false notification\" letters in to \nin's alleged victims saying \"(t)his case is currently under investigation.\" However, the office had signed the agreement \nEpstein in September 2007. \nittorneys want a court hearing during which they will ask that the agreement be invalidated because it violated the \nis' rights.

If that happens, it could open up the 58-year-old \nPalm Beach billionaire to a slew of federal charges involving sex \ncrimes with minors that were set aside by the agreement. \nThe motion, filed Monday in federal court in West Palm Beach, \naccuses the U.S. Attorney's Office of deliberately misleading the \nvictims by telling them the investigation was ongoing, while \nconcealing they had already signed a deal with Epstein. \nAccording to the motion, the U.S. Attorney's Office sent \"false \nnotification\" letters in January 2008 and May 2008 to the victims \nsaying \"(t)his case is currently under investigation\" after the \ngovernment had signed the agreement with Epstein in September \n2007. \n\"The only reason that the (U.S. Attorney's Office) concealed the \nexistence of the non-prosecution agreement from the victims was \nnot to comply with some legal restriction, but rather to avoid a \nfirestorm of public controversy that would have erupted if the \nsweetheart plea deal with a politically connected billionaire had been \nrevealed,\" the motion says. \nIf Epstein were found guilty on federal charges, statutory penalties \nranged from 10 years to life. \nInstead, the sealed pact was part and parcel of Epstein's \nacceptance of a state plea deal, where he received an 18-month \nsentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution and soliciting \nprostitution. He served 13 months segregated in a vacant wing of \nthe county stockade and was let out on work release six days a \nweek for up to 16 hours a day. \nEdwards and other attorneys fought in court for a year before \nsuccessfully getting the agreement unsealed in September 2009. \nMore than 30 minor girls were identified as Epstein's victims in the \nnact \nSite Q Web \n1.

They are \namong more than two-dozen underage girls who filed lawsuits or \nsettled claims against Epstein, alleging they were lured to his Palm \nBeach mansion to give him sexually charged massages and/or sex \nin exchange for money. \nThe motion filed Monday says the agreement is illegal because the \ngovernment did not protect the \"Congressionally mandated rights of \nvictims before it entered this agreement.\" \nAlicia Valle, special counsel for the U.S. Attorney's Office Southern \nDistrict of Florida, said in an e-mail that the U.S. Attorney's Office \nwill respond in court filings. \n\"However, as we stated more than two years ago in July 2008 in our \nresponse to the plaintiffs' then-emergency petition for enforcement \nof the Crime Victim Rights Act, the CVRA was not violated because \nno federal charges were ever filed in the Southern District of \nFlorida,\" Valle said. \"Because the matter remains pending in court, it \nwould be inappropriate at this time to provide additional comment on \nthe merits of the current motion.\" \nThe attorneys reference e-mails and letters from the federal office to \nEpstein's lawyers acknowledging the government's legal obligation \nto inform victims about the pact. The e-mails are redacted in the \nmotion because they are under seal. The attorneys filed a separate \nmotion Monday to unseal the correspondence. \n\"The reasonable inference from the evidence is that the U.S. \nAttorney's Office wanted to keep the agreement a secret to avoid \nintense criticism that would surely ensued had the victims and the \npublic learned that a billionaire sex offender with political \nconnections had arranged to avoid federal prosecution for numerous \nfelony sex offenses against minor girls,\" the motion says. \"As part of \nthis pattern of deception, the U.S. Attorney's Office discussed victim \nnotification with the defendant sex offender and, after he raised \nobjections, stopped making notifications.\" \nEpstein sought \"a higher level of review\" within the Department of \nJustice, the motion says. \"A reasonable inference from the evidence \nis that Epstein used his significant political and social connections to \nlobby the Justice Department to avoid significant federal \nprosecution,\" the motion states. \nShare this article: \nCOMMENTS \nComments are closed \nNEWS \tSOCIETY \tWEATHER \tARTS \tADVERTISE \tSPECIAL SECTIONS \nReligion \tInsider \tSPORTS \tArts Calendar \tSERVICES \tPalm Beach Life \nArchives \tSocial Calendar \tPolo \tOBITUARIES \tSubscriber Services \tHome & Loggia \nProfilePalmBeach \u000bMadoff \tFASHION \tWEF \tLIFESTYLES \tHelp & FAQ \tAutomotive & Yacht \u000bShowcase \nSpecial Reports \tFashion Calendar \tBUSINESS \tLocations \tVisitors' Guide \nTown Council \tAnnouncements \tReprints \tSeason in Review \nFeral Cats \tOPINION \tBLOGS \tFood \tStaff \tHurricane Guide 2010 \nPlaza \tLocal Voices \tCOLUMNISTS \tWorvenue \u000bth A \tPrivacy ic \u000bPol Y \tChamber of Commerce \nReach 8 \tLetters to the Editor \tPets \tAbout Us \tNewsletter \nHealth \tSubmit a Letter \tVisitor Agreement \u000bSubscribe \nREAL ESTATE \nhttp:/ /www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/attorneys-want-jeffrey-epstein-agreement-th rown-out-1338111.html Page 2 of 3 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013409 \nAttorneys want Jeffrey Epstein agreement thrown out 4/7/11 1:37 PM \nCopyright@ Thu Apr 07 13:33:34 EDT 2011 All rights reserved.

McKenna reserved ruling on whether the recording will be released to \nattorneys representing young women who were sexually abused by Epstein as minors. McKenna didn't \nlisten to the recording during the hearing. Fort Lauderdale attorney Brad Edwards and Utah attorney and \nlaw professor Paul Cassell are fighting to obtain the 22-minute tape on behalf of Epstein victim Jane Doe. \nShe has filed one of a dozen pending civil cases in federal court in West Palm Beach against Epstein. \nA status check is set for Thursday in those cases before U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra. \nDoe could have settled the lawsuit for $50,000 but is asking for $50 million in damages, Cassell said \nTuesday. \"Jane Doe was repeatedly sexually assaulted over a lengthy period of time by this wealthy and \npowerful man,\" Cassell said. \nEpstein, 57, is currently under house arrest in his Palm Beach home after serving 13 months of an 18-\nmonth state sentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution and soliciting prostitution. Nearly two dozen \nyoung women have filed lawsuits against the billionaire money manager -- some already settled -- all \nalleging Epstein sexually abused them as minors at his El Brillo Way home. \nCites reporter's protected privilege \nRush, of the New York Daily News, was present in the courtroom, but did not have to testify Tuesday. \nNeither did Fort Lauderdale private investigator Michael Fisten, also in the courtroom. Working on behalf \nof Epstein victims, Fisten discovered the existence of the tape and had a conversation with Rush about its \ncontents. \nRepresenting Rush and the newspaper, Washington attorney Laura Handman and New York Daily News \nattorney Anne Carroll argued the tape should not be released under any circumstances, citing reporter's \nprotected privilege. Rush told Epstein the conversation was \"off the record\" and has never published any \nportion of that conversation. But even if portions had been printed, the unpublished portions would still be \nprotected, Handman said. \nHandman cited cases where interviews were conducted in the presence of other people and privilege was \nnot waived. \nIn addition, Handman argued that Rush should not have to testify in court. \nThe ability for reporter's privilege to be protected is crucial in culling sources and gathering information for \nnews stories, Handman said. Reporting is all about give and take between the reporter and the source; \nthat's what reporters have to do, Handman said. \n\"This is so critical to news gathering,\" Handman said. \"Mr. Rush could find himself testifying in [many] \ncases just because he had the temerity to do some reporting on a very important story.\" \nThere is nothing helpful to Doe's case on the tape and \"Jane Doe is not referred to once in that tape,\" \nHandman said. \nCassell argued that the tape is \"critical in showing Epstein's lack of remorse.\" \nCassell described Epstein as a pitiless sexual abuser to Jane Doe and at least 30 other minor girls. Even \nthough Jane Doe is not referred to by name on the tape, Epstein refers to his victims as \"the girls\" and \nmakes disparaging remarks about them on the tape, Cassell said. \nTape played for others \nCassell said privilege does not apply because it was waived when Rush played the tape for three people \nand verbally divulged its contents to two others, including Fisten and Edwards, who also represents two \nother victims. But even if there is \"qualified privilege,\" Cassell says, it is outweighed by Doe's inability to \nobtain the information anywhere else and the jury's need to hear Epstein's own words about his lack of \nremorse. \nSince Epstein has exercised his Fifth Amendment right during questioning by victims' attorneys, the jury \nClassifieds \nReal Estate \nAdvertise \nAutomotive \n,Ifisotp \nDLO\n/CI \nby \nShannon Donnelly \nhttp://nLnewsban k.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&p_doci...ername=dkiesq&s_accountid=AC0111040620221012261&s_upgradeable=no Page 1 of 2 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013411 \nPalm Beach Daily News: Archives 4/7/11 1:35 PM \nwill have no other way to hear Epstein's words in his own voice, Cassell said. \nDeadline for discovery in the Doe case is May 31, with the trial set for July 14. \nmdargan@pbdailynews.com \nCopyright (c) 2010 Palm Beach Daily News \nRefinance Rates at 2.650/0  \n$160,000 Mortgage for $659/mo.

Edwards represents Doe and two other Epstein victims. Edwards and Cassell are fighting to \nobtain the tape to further their case of sexual abuse by Epstein when Doe was a minor. \nEpstein, 57, was released from jail in July after serving 13 months of an 18-month state sentence for \nsoliciting a minor for prostitution and soliciting prostitution. Nearly two dozen young women have filed \nlawsuits against Epstein -- some already settled -- all alleging Epstein sexually abused them as minors at \nhis El Brillo Way home, where he is now serving house arrest. \nThe New York Daily News is seeking to keep the tape confidential, citing reporter's protected privilege. \nIn response, Cassell says the newspaper waived its protected privilege when Rush played the recording \nfor three people and described its contents to two others, including Edwards. \nIn addition, Cassell writes that privilege can't be applied in this situation because it doesn't involve an \nissue related to a confidential source. The person on the tape is Epstein. \nEven if there is \"qualified privilege,\" Cassell maintains it is outweighed by Doe's inability to obtain the \ninformation anywhere else and her \"compelling need to obtain Jeffrey Epstein's own words about his \nsexual abuse and lack of remorse.\" \nWhen reached by phone Wednesday, Anne Carroll, attorney for the New York Daily News, said she will \nanswer Cassell in a court filing. Both the New York Daily News and Doe have asked a federal court judge \nin Manhattan to listen to the tape in chambers to help determine whether privilege applies. \nEpstein and others who helped him procure minor girls for massages and sex acts have taken the Fifth \nAmendment in their depositions, stymieing Doe and the other victims suing Epstein, the documents say. \nMichael Fisten, an investigator working for Doe, discovered the existence of the tape in fall 2009. An \nauthor who had listened to the tape told Fisten that Rush had a tape recording of Epstein \"discussing the \nsexual abuse of minor girls.\" \nAccording to a sworn affidavit by Fisten, he called Rush, who confirmed he interviewed Epstein and made \na tape. According to Fisten, Rush told him that he compiled negative information from Epstein about his \nexploits with underage girls and how he eluded the justice system. But Fisten said that Rush told him that \nhis publisher, who knows Epstein, killed it after receiving a call from Epstein. \nFisten said Rush told him, among other things, that the following information was contained on the tape: \nThat Epstein said he went to jail in Florida for no reason and if the sexual abuse of minors had happened \nin New York, he would have only received a $200 fine. \nThat L.M., one of Edwards' clients who sued Epstein for sexual abuse as a minor, came to him as a \nprostitute and a drug user (meaning she came to him for sex, rather than him pursuing her). \nThat all the girls suing him are only trying to get a meal ticket. \nThat the only thing he might have done wrong was to maybe cross the line a little too closely. \nIn a sworn deposition, Edwards states that Rush disclosed much of the information contained on the tape \nto him in a conversation. \nEdwards said in his statement that the Rush interview is \"unique and not otherwise obtainable from other \nwitnesses because it can be used to prove perjury -- a federal crime. \nEdwards said Epstein testified in a deposition that he did not recognize the name George Rush from the \nNew York Daily News \"despite the fact that he gave a personal interview that we all now know to have \nbeen tape recorded.\" \nmdargan@pbdailynews.com \nStart or \nRenew Your \nSubscription \nThursday, April 7, 2011 \nSHINY SHOTS ADVERTISE \"NTACT US \nAdvertise \nAutomotive \nupdates in your e-mail \nSign up to receive \nour e-mail \nnewsletters here. \n- \nPalm Beach Daily News \nNEWSLETTERS \nSUBSCRIBE \nhttp://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&p_doci...ername=dkiesg&s_accountid=AC0111040620221012261&s_upgradeable=no \nPage 1 of 2 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013413 \nPalm Beach Daily News: Archives 4/7/11 1:32 PM \nEpstein \nHas 'come close to crossing a line.' \nCopyright (c) 2010 Palm Beach Daily News \nRefinance Rates at 2.650/0  \n$160,000 Mortgage for $659/mo.

He received an 18-month jail sentence, of which \nhe served 13. \nA former federal prosecutor of 15 years, Mark Johnson of Stuart, said the disparity in the potential sentences was \nunusual. \nThe United States Attorney's Office also agreed not to charge any of Epstein's possible co-conspirators - Sarah \nKellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff and Nadia Marcinkova. \nThe agreement was negotiated in part by New York heavyweight criminal defense attorney Gerald Lefcourt. \nOn its first draft in September 2007, it required that Epstein pay an attorney - tapped by the U.S. Attorney's Office \nand approved by Epstein - to represent some of the victims in civil suits they had filed against Epstein. That \nattorney is prominent Miami lawyer Bob Josefsberg. \nFormer prosecutor Johnson said he has never seen a provision like that before. \nBut an addendum to the agreement signed the following month struck Epstein's duty to pay Josefsberg if he and the \nvictims did not accept a settlement and instead pursued litigation. \nThe agreement, signed by Assistant U.S. Attorney Maria Villafana, does not expressly state whether any victims \nwere contacted or consulted before the deal was made. \nAttorney Brad Edwards of Fort Lauderdale, who represents three of the young women, believes that none of the \nbetween 30 and 40 woman identified as victims in the federal investigation were told of the deal. Edwards said his \nclients were still receiving letters in the mail months afterwards saying the U.S. Attorney's Office assuring them \nEpstein would be prosecuted. \n\"Never consulting the victims is probably the most outrageous aspect of it...\" Edwards said. \"It taught them that \nsomeone with money can buy his way out of anything. It's outrageous and embarrassing for United States \nAttorney's Office and the State Attorneys Office.\" \nEpstein now faces many civil lawsuits filed by the women, who are represented by a variety attorneys. In many, the \nfacts alleged are the same: that Epstein had a predilection for teenage girls, identified poor, vulnerable ones and \nlured them to his home via other young women. The teens describe ascending a staircase lined with nude \nphotographs of young girls and to the spa room where Epstein would appear in a small towel. \nFormer Circuit Judge Bill Berger, who represents one of the victims, and The Palm Beach Post sought the \nunsealing of the agreement. Berger refers to it as a \"sweetheart deal.\" \n\"Why was it so important for the government to make this deal?\" Berger asked rhetorically. \"We have not yet had \nhonest explanation by any public official as to why it was made .. and why the victim's were sold down the river.\" \nFormer federal prosecutor Ryon McCabe described the agreement as \"very unorthodox.\" Such agreements, he said, \nare usually reserved for corporations, not individuals. \nhttp://www.palmbeachpost.com/ pbcwest/content/local_news/epaper/2009/09/18/0918epstein.html \nSEARCH \n® Site 0 Web Web Search by YAHOO! \nObarna Launches Mortgage Relief Plan \nIf you owe  less than S720 000 on .._„•-c,,Jr \n_ mortgage,you_probably c Jalify for the  \nPresident's Making Home Affordable  \nProgram.

I've never seen or heard of the procedure that was set up here.\" said McCabe, who has no \ninvolvement in any Epstein litigation and is now a securities litigation attorney. \n\"He's essentially avoiding federal prosecution because he can afford to pay that many lawyers to help those victims \nreview their cases.... If a person has no money he couldn't be able to strike a deal like this and avoid federal \nprosecution.\" \nThe back-room deal with federal prosecutors all the more interesting in light of the legal heavyweights who have \nworked for Epstein, including Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz and Kenneth Starr of Clinton impeachment fame. \nLefcourt is a past president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. \nEpstein's local defense attorney, Jack Goldberger, issued a statement Friday saying he had fought the release of \nthe sealed agreement to protect the third parties named there. \"Mr. Epstein has fully abided by all of its terms and \nconditions. He is looking forward to putting this difficult period in his life behind him. He is continuing his long \nstanding history of science philanthropy...\" \nEpstein ended up avoiding federal charges, and pleaded guilty in state court to felony solicitation of prostitution and \nprocuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution. In July 2008, he was sentenced to 18 months in jail, and \nlater allowed out up to six days a week on work release. \nEpstein left the jail in late July 2009 after serving not quite 13 months of the sentence, having earned gain time for \ngood behavior. \nPalm Beach Police began investigating the \"international moneyman of mystery,\" as the New York magazine \ndubbed him, after they received a complaint from a relative of a 14-year-old girl who had given Epstein a naked \nmassage at his home on the Intracoastal Waterway. \nPolice sought and found in poor neighborhoods a variety of tall, thin, model-like young women, who told stories of \nbegin recruiting, then going to Epstein's home and massaging and stimulating him. They walked away with between \n$200 and $1,000. \nThe investigation triggered tensions between police and prosecutors, with then-Chief Michael Reiter saying in a \nMay 2006 letter to then-State Attorney Barry Krischer that the chief prosecutor should disqualify himself. \n\"I continue to find your office's treatment of these cases highly unusual,\" Reiter wrote. He then asked for and got \nthe federal investigation that ended in the sealed deal. \n\"The Jeffrey Epstein matter was an experience of what a many-million-dollar defense can accomplish,\" Reiter told \nthe Palm Beach Daily News upon his retirement. \nhttp://www.palmbeachpost.com/pbcwest/content/local_news/epaper/2009/09/18/0918epstein.html \nRick \nHeidy Vero \nAudrey \nGabriel \nDebra Robin \n• \nJeffrey Katie Jodie \nRecent Activity \nLogin \nYou need to be logged into Facebook to \nsee your friends activity \nCerabino: Florida House GOP's 'uterus' \nban: A free-speech battle is born \n1,518 people shared this. \nLIForeclosure crisis: Fed-up judges crack \ndown disorder in the courts \n207 people shared this. \nFacebook social plug in \nPOSTPIX » Latest news photos \nMAGES OF WAR in Iraq Massive earthquake and \nand Afghanistan tsunami devastate Japan \nJeri Muoio Sworn in as Severe weather in Central, \nMayor South Florida \nIDo Your Feet Hurt?  \nSELBY SHOES \n561-969-9369 \nWe'Ll Put Wow!

Although Edwards and his victims have seen the \nagreement, Edwards says in his pleadings that the government has \"inaccurately described the agreement ... \ncreating a false impression that the agreement protects the victims.\" \nU.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra ruled that the claims, even if true, haven't damaged Edwards' case. \n\"If and when such alleged mischaracterizations become relevant to an issue to be decided by the court, the parties \nwill be given the opportunity to advance their positions and the court will resolve the issue,\" he wrote. \"If disclosure \nof the agreement will be required for the court to resolve this issue, appropriate disclosure will be ordered.\" \nSeeking to keep the agreement sealed, Assistant U.S. Attorney Dexter Lee argued that the agreement is not part of \nany case before Marra. \n\"The non-prosecution agreement has never been filed under seal in federal court,\" he wrote. \nHe also denied that the agreement has been inaccurately described. \nMarra sided with Lee on the argument that the agreement was not filed in federal court \"under seal or otherwise.\" \nOn Aug. 14, Marra ruled that the non-prosecution agreement would be unsealed for Edwards and any of the victims \nwho want to see it. But the ruling bars Edwards and anyone else who sees the document from disclosing the terms \nto anyone else. \nIn his motion to unseal, Edwards said he wants to be able to discuss the terms of the agreement with other victims \nand their attorneys as well as with other victims' rights groups such as the National Alliance of Victims' Rights \nAttorneys. \nThe desire to discuss the agreement with third parties is not justification for unsealing the document, Marra ruled. \n\"If a specific tangible need arises in a civil case relief should be sought in that case,\" he wrote. \nEpstein, 56, is serving 18 months in jail for soliciting prostitution and procuring a minor for prostitution. \nUnder the agreement, federal prosecutors will defer their decision on whether to prosecute Epstein on federal \ncharges until 90 days after Epstein completes all requirements of his state sentence. \nIf he abides by all court conditions and restrictions, the federal case would be dropped. \nIn addition to the state criminal case, there are nine federal and seven state lawsuits pending against Epstein. \nAll contain similar allegations: The Manhattan money manager, through his employees and assistants, brought \nminor girls to his Palm Beach home at 358 El Brillo Way for erotic massages and sometimes sex. \n(3 Site 0 Web \nSEARCH \nWeb Search by YAHOO! \nACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE \nSPECIALIST \nBusy Physical Therapy office \nseeks FULL TIME AR Collection \nperson to handle txttient accounts. \nClit'k \nApply! \nEXPERIENCE PREFERRED \nCOLUMNISTS AND BLOGGERS \n111 \nMOST POPULAR \nFRANK CERABINO \nRead Frank's latest columns \nand follow him on Twitter. \nRead more \nHOT CELEBRITY NEWS \nGet the latest on South Florida \ncelebrities, billionaires, \npoliticos, more.

A.1 \nLENGTH: 557 words \nHEADLINE: JUDGE TO RULE ON SEALED PLEA-DEAL PAPERS TODAY \nBYLINE: MICHELE DARGAN, MICHELE DARGAN, Daily News Staff Writer \nBODY: \nA circuit judge will decide today whether the public will be privy to the federal government's non-prosecution deal \nwith Jeffrey Epstein, which was sealed when the convicted sex offender pleaded guilty in June 2008 to two felony \ncounts. \nEpstein, of Palm Beach, will be released from the Palm Beach County Stockade July 22, after serving less than 13 \nmonths of his 18- month sentence for procuring a minor for prostitution and solicitation of prostitution. \nTeri Barbera, spokeswoman for the Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office, confirmed his release date Tuesday. \nEpstein's projected release date had been Sept. 24, but gain time -- which includes his participation in a \nwork-release program -- moves the date up to July 22, Barbera said. \nEpstein, 56, has been in the work-release program since Oct. 10, in which he is allowed out of the stockade six days \na week, from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., to go to his West Palm Beach office, the Florida Science Foundation, monitored by an \nankle bracelet and accompanied by a deputy. \nAs part of Epstein's state plea agreement, the U.S. Attorneys Office agreed not to prosecute Epstein on federal \ncharges as long as he fulfills all requirements of his sentence and probation. The federal non-prosecution agreement has \nbeen under seal in state court. \nEpstein's attorney Jack Goldberger filed court papers asking that the documents stay sealed for the following rea-\nsons: \"to prevent a serious imminent threat to the fair, impartial and orderly administration of justice; to protect a com-\npelling government interest; to avoid substantial injury to innocent third parties and to avoid substantial injury to a party \nby disclosure of matters protected by a common law and privacy right, not generally inherent in these specific type of \nproceedings, sought to be closed.\" \nFort Lauderdale-based attorney Brad Edwards represents three Epstein victims and has asked Circuit Judge Jeffrey \nColbath to unseal the federal agreement to the public. An attorney for The Palm Beach Post also has asked that the rec-\nords be unsealed. \nEdwards and his clients have seen the agreement after a federal judge ruled that they are allowed to see it. But that \nruling bars Edwards and anyone else who sees the document from disclosing the terms to anyone else. \nEdwards said he wants to use that document \"in the deposition of various material witnesses\" relative to his cases. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013421 \nPage 2 \nJUDGE TO RULE ON SEALED PLEA-DEAL PAPERS TODAY Palm Beach Daily News June 25, 2009 Thursday \nRadaronline.com has reported that Epstein has \"secretly been helping the feds unravel a Ponzi scheme\" related to \nthe June 2008 indictment of two former managers of Bear Stearns Mortgage Investment Fund. \nEpstein's rep, Howard Rubenstein, confirmed last year that Epstein is \"Major Investor No. 1\" in the indictment, \nwhich says he lost about $57 million. \nGoldberger could not be reached for comment. \nThe Manhattan money manager has been incarcerated since June 30, when he pleaded guilty to the two felony \ncounts. As part of the plea agreement, Epstein must serve one year of house arrest after his release and register as a life-\nlong sex offender. \nIn addition to the criminal case, there are more than a dozen civil lawsuits -- both state and federal -- pending \nagainst Epstein. All contain similar allegations: Epstein, through his employees and assistants, brought minor girls to his \nPalm Beach home on El Brillo Way for erotic massages and sometimes sex. \nmdargan@pbdailynews.com \nGRAPHIC: Caption: Epstein To be released from jail July 22. \nLOAD-DATE: September 1, 2010 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013422 \nHeiress quizzed in sex suits - NYPOST.com \n4/6/1 1 1:5 1 PM \n1lAt 51 0 Today's Paper Login Register Classifieds E Archives Subscribe \nNEW YORK POST \nLast Updated:Wed., Apr. 6 \nNews \n2011, 01:45pm \nBERGDORF GUDDMAN \nDerek Jeter Carmelo Anthony Jay-Z Donald Trump \nPhrase-y Charlie \nHe wants to leave his mark --\non your wallet.

A grand jury indicted \nEpstein on a charge of felony solicitation of prostitution. \nEpstein, who pleaded guilty and did 12 months in prison, was \ndeposed last week in the offices of his lawyer, Jack \nGoldberger. \nGoldberger wouldn't comment, but a friend of Epstein said, \n\"These [people bringing the complaint] are the lowest of the \nlows in terms of ambulance-chasing lawyers.\" The trials are \nscheduled to start in February. \nNadia Marcinkova, who has been described as Epstein's \nlesbian sex slave and who visited him behind bars 67 times, \nhas also been served with a subpoena. \nEpstein's brother, Mark Epstein, who has a real-estate \nholding company in New York, has already been deposed \nabout a building he owns, 301 E. 66th St. \"Jeffrey rents \nseveral apartments there where he keeps his girls, alleged \nmodels for the MC2 agency he owns,\" Edwards said. \"But \nMark acts like he doesn't even know his brother.

The public should be outraged it \nhas gone as far as it has.\" \nBrad Edwards, a second attorney representing the women, has seen the sealed deal after a federal judge allowed \nhim and his clients to view it, but would not discuss its contents. \nEdwards would say only that the women were \"outraged\" that it had been negotiated behind their backs. \nA reporter asked Edwards whether he thought Epstein received special treatment by federal prosecutors. \n\"Are you kidding?

Certainly, no one else gets treated like that,\" Edwards said. \nEpstein, 56, a reported money manager of billionaires, is serving an 18-month sentence in the Palm Beach County \nStockade after pleading guilty almost a year ago in state court to felony solicitation of prostitution and procuring teen-\nagers for prostitution.

A.1 \nLENGTH: 561 words \nHEADLINE: EPSTEIN PLEA DEAL TO REMAIN SEALED FOR NOW \nBYLINE: DAVID ROGERS, DAVID ROGERS, Daily News Staff Writer \nBODY: \nThe plea deal that part-time Palm Beacher Jeffrey Epstein agreed to several months ago to avoid federal charges \nwill remain sealed for the time being. \nLawyers for The Palm Beach Post and a woman who claimed Epstein solicited and procured her for sex at his El \nBrillo Way home while she was underage asked Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Jeffrey Colbath Wednesday morning \nto unseal the plea documents immediately. \nInstead, Colbath decided to leave the documents sealed and give Jack Goldberger, the attorney representing Ep-\nstein, until 1 p.m. Friday to file papers showing why the records should remain out of public view. \nColbath agreed to let the Post and \"E.W.\" have standing in the case and set a hearing on whether the documents \nshould be unsealed for 1:30 p.m. June 25. \nEpstein agreed in September 2007 to plead to state charges to avoid federal prosecution, Goldberger told County \nJudge Deborah Pucillo at Epstein's plea conference last year. \nThe sealing of the records in question was said to be a \"significant inducement\" for Epstein, who is serving 18 \nmonths in the Palm Beach County Stockade -- with daytime release -- and is facing several civil lawsuits in state and \nfederal courts by more than a dozen alleged victims. \nColbath said, \"I don't see where any of the proper procedures to seal the documents were ever followed ...\" but that \nhe would give Epstein's legal team the ability to \"jump through the hoops to seal the documents if they are entitled in \nfact to be sealed.\" \nThe sealing of court documents in Florida is unusual and lawyers typically have to prove a significant reason for it, \nsuch as protecting trade secrets or a compelling government interest. \nGoldberger said after the hearing there is no rush to unseal the plea deal. \n\"I think the records clearly need to be sealed and continue to be sealed but I think the ruling by Judge Colbath was a \nvery well- reasoned practical decision,\" Goldberger said. \"He is not getting special treatment.\" \nBrad Edwards, of the law firm of Rothstein Rosenfeldt Adler of Fort Lauderdale, said the plea deal should be a \npublic record. His firm represents the woman, now 20, who was identified only as E.W. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013428 \nPage 2 \nEPSTEIN PLEA DEAL TO REMAIN SEALED FOR NOW Palm Beach Daily News June 11, 2009 Thursday \nWhether procedure was followed is not the issue, he said. \n\"Certainly it should be unsealed regardless. I mean this is a very unusual circumstance where a document like this \nwould be sealed,\" Edwards said. \"None of the other criminal defendants in there (Judge Colbath's courtroom) had their \nplea bargains, plea agreements, their non-prosecution agreements, sealed.\" \nEdwards said his firm represents three women who claim they were procured for sex with Epstein when they were \nunderage. The three are outraged that the document is under wraps, Edwards said. \nDeanna Shullman, the attorney representing the Post, said the public and the press have a constitutional right of ac-\ncess to public records in Florida. \n\"Fortunately, the status quo is openness. So I think the judge has the idea that the initial closure was done without \nany adherence to those procedures but was inclined to give Mr. Epstein's lawyers additional time to prove that they \nshould be sealed in accordance with these procedures,\" Shullman said. \nIts a little disappointing in that we would have liked to see the judge unseal the record because that's what should \nbe the status quo in a situation like this, Shullman said. \ndrogers \n@pbdailynews. com \nLOAD-DATE: September 1, 2010 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013429 \nPage 1 \n0 ,  LexisNexis' \n1 of 11 DOCUMENTS \nCopyright 2009 Associated Newspapers Ltd. \nAll Rights Reserved \nThe Evening Standard (London) \nDecember 24, 2009 Thursday \nLENGTH: 824 words \nHEADLINE: CITY SPY \nBODY: \nEXPECT more media firms to announce plans to charge for content online in early 2010.

But given the number of \"seasonal sales\" that started on the High Street at least a \nweek before Christmas, it would be no surprise to see some retailers come a cropper sooner... \nEPSTEIN PILOT TAKES TO THE ROAD \nFURTHER news reaches City Spy of former Bear Stearns trader, Prince Andrew's shooting companion and con-\nvicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein. \nThe ex-Wall Street star served 13 months in jail on criminal charges of soliciting prostitution and procuring a minor \nfor prostitution and he now faces civil claims from young women accusing him of having unlawful sex with them. This \nweek, City Spy recounted how Epstein had transferred the title deeds of his prized 2003 Ferrari 575M Maranello to his \nprivate pilot Larry Visoki, prior to the car going on sale for $159,000 (£99,000) (possibly to help Epstein pay his legal \nbills). It turns out, the same Visoki was deposed last week by Bradley Edwards, an attorney for three of the women su-\ning Epstein. Questioned by Edwards about plane passengers who might have witnessed Epstein in the company of \nyoung girls, Visoki admitted Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, former Colombian \npresident Andres Pastrana Arango, Obama economic adviser Lawrence Summers, billionaire Ron Burkle, and actors \nKevin Spacey and Chris Tucker had been on board the plane while young girls were present. Fortuitously for Epstein, \nhowever, Ferrari-selling Visoki swore on oath that he never suspected his boss of having sex with them. \nOf course not, Larry. Now drive off into the sunset. \nMore on Prince Andrew, our special representative for international trade and investment. The European Parliament \nand the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe have strongly condemned Azerbaijan for tightening re-\nstrictions on the media and jailing two bloggers who were critical of the government. It transpires the oil-rich country \nhas long blocked BBC broadcasts there, which might explain why oft-criticised Andrew and former Prime Minister \nTony Blair spend so much time visiting the sometime Soviet State. \nWhat does the snow have in common with the recession?

To me, its \nmore spectacular what's not in it. Its the U.S. Attorneys Office saying well do everything in our power to see he doesn't \nget punished.\" \nEdwards has been fighting for a year in federal and state court to unseal the agreement. \n\"The non-prosecution agreement raises more questions than it answers,\" said Miami attorney Adam Horowitz, who \nrepresents seven victims. \"Why did all the co-conspirators receive immunity? Why were the victims not consulted re-\ngarding the sentence? Why did he receive such a minimal sentence? \nThe federal deal has remained sealed in Epstein's state court file since he pleaded guilty in June 2008 to state \ncharges of procuring a minor for prostitution and soliciting prostitution. \nU.S. Attorneys Office does not comment \nThe federal charges he could have faced were: conspiracy to persuade minor females to engage in prostitution, \nconspiracy to travel to engage in illicit sexual conduct with minor females, persuading minor females to engage in pros-\ntitution, traveling to engage in illicit sexual conduct with minor females and causing a person under 18 years to engage \nin sex for money while knowing they are underage. \nThe charges carry various statutory penalities ranging from 10 years to life, with a minimum mandatory of at least \n10 years. \nAlicia Valle, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorneys Office in Miami, declined comment. \nExpert: Feds take few sex-assault cases \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013432 \nPage 2 \nATTORNEY FOR EPSTEIN VICTIMS: 1 HAVE NEVER SEEN A STRANGER CASE Palm Beach Daily News \nSeptember 20, 2009 Sunday \nNorth Palm Beach criminal defense attorney Barry Maxwell said he is not surprised that federal charges weren't \nfiled. \n\"My experience has been that the federal government does not intervene in sex-assault cases, except if were deal-\ning with a serial rapist or it crosses jurisdictional lines,\" Maxwell said. \"Ifs either not a big enough case or not atrocious \nenough for them.\" \nEpstein, 56, served 13 months of his 18-month sentence at the Palm Beach County Stockade and received liberal \nwork-release privileges while in jail. He was able to go to his West Palm Beach office six days a week for up to 16 \nhours a day. \nHe is now serving one year of probation at his Palm Beach mansion and is registered as a lifelong sex offender. \nEpstein 'fully abided' by deal, says defense \nEpstein's attorney Jack Goldberger released the following statement: \"This document relates to allegations that \nwere made many years ago. It was by its provisions and agreement of the parties to remain confidential in part to protect \nthe identities of collateral third parties. \n\"Mr. Epstein has fully abided by all of its terms and conditions. He is looking forward to putting this difficult peri-\nod of his life behind him. He is continuing his longstanding history of science philanthropy both here in South Florida \nand nationwide.\" \nGoldberger had blocked the unsealing by filing court papers asking that the documents stay sealed \"to prevent a se-\nrious imminent threat to the fair, impartial and orderly administration of justice; to protect a compelling government \ninterest; to avoid substantial injury to innocent third parties; and to avoid substantial injury to a party by disclosure of \nmatters protected by a common law and privacy right, not generally inherent in these specific type of proceedings, \nsought to be closed.\" \nCircuit Judge Jeffrey Colbath ordered the agreement to be unsealed in June, but Epstein's attorneys appealed the \nruling to the Fourth District Court of Appeals, which affirmed Colbath's ruling. Colbath had ruled that the federal \nagreement -- sealed in state court -- was improperly sealed. \nfelt it was my fault' \nMore than a dozen lawsuits against the billionaire money manager have been filed in federal and state court, all \nwith similar allegations: that a minor girl was taken to Epstein's mansion on El Brillo Way and led upstairs to a spa \nroom by one of Epstein's assistants, where he would ask the girl to perform massages and/or various sex acts, for which \nhe would pay her. \nOne victim, who is known as Jane Doe #5 in a federal court lawsuit against Epstein, said she didn't find out about \nthe deal until after it was finalized. She was 15 at the time one of her schoolmates told her she could make $200 by giv-\ning a massage to a man in Palm Beach. \nShe says she was \"nervous and scared and wanted to leave\" once she got to Epstein's spa room. \n\"I thought, 1 can't call my dad or my mom because Pm stuck in this situation and didn't know what to do,\" she said. \n\"I really didn't know what this man was capable of For a long time, I felt like it was my fault and that's exactly what he \nwanted me to feel.\" \nEpstein has curfew \nWhile he is serving the 12 months of house arrest at his Palm Beach home, Epstein must observe a 10 p.m. to 6 \na.m. curfew, have no unsupervised contact with anyone younger than 18 and not view, own or possess pornographic or \nsexual materials. \nThe indictment followed an 11-month investigation by Palm Beach police, who said Epstein paid five underage \ngirls for massages and sometimes sex at his El Brillo Way home. Then-State Attorney Barry Krischer declined to pros-\necute Epstein on multiple charges involving unlawful sex acts with minors. Instead, he brought the case to a grand jury, \nwhich charged Epstein on the lesser charge of soliciting prostitution. \nThen-Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter wrote Krischer a letter asking him to recuse himself from the case. \nWhen that didn't happen, Reiter requested an FBI investigation to determine if any federal laws were broken. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013433 \nPage 3 \nATTORNEY FOR EPSTEIN VICTIMS: 1 HAVE NEVER SEEN A STRANGER CASE Palm Beach Daily News \nSeptember 20, 2009 Sunday \nOut of the ordinary' \nWest Palm Beach criminal defense attorney Gregg Lerman said several aspects of the Epstein case are unusual. \n\"I don't understand why it would be a federal case in this circumstance, and why was there anything in writing at all \nand why did they seal the agreement?\" Lerman said. \"Why did it go to the grand jury instead of through the state filing \nlewd assault charges?

Although Kim is a physician by training, officials have observed that Kim's role as a key \nplayer in global health and development, notably with his role in the organization Partners in Health (PIH), \nmakes him a key candidate to change the attitudes of developing-world nations. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013460 \nThe following excerpts from Tracy Kidder's Mountains Beyond Mountains, a biography of anthropologist and \nphysician Paul Farmer, detail Kim's bold efforts to combat international HIV and tuberculosis epidemics with \nPIH: \nSome months after the official founding of PIH, [co-founder] Paul Farmer expanded the group, adding a fellow \nHarvard anthropology and medical student, a Korean American named Jim Yong Kim... Farmer offered what \nfor Jim Kim was a convincing vision of the new organization. The reality was less impressive -- a charity with a \nboard of advisers and no hired staff... \nThey talked about issues such as political correctness, which Jim Kim defined as follows: \"It's a very well-\ncrafted tool to distract us. A very self-centered activity. Clean up your own vocabulary so you can show \neverybody you have the social capital of having been in circles where these things are talked about on a regular \nbasis.\" (What was an example of political correctness? Some academic types would say to Jim and Paul, \"Why \ndo you call your patients poor people? They don't call themselves poor people.\" Jim would reply: \"Okay, how \nabout soon-dead people?\") \nThey talked about the insignificance of \"cultural barriers\" when it came to the Haitian peasant's acceptance of \nmodern Western medicine: \"There's nothing like a cure for a disease to change people's cultural values\"... \nBy now Peru was taxing PIH's resources severely. On average, the drugs to treat just one patient cost between \nfifteen and twenty thousand dollars. And the number of patients kept growing. Already there were about fifty \nCarabayllanos in treatment. Their average age was twenty-nine. They were students, unemployed youths, \nhousewives, street vendors, bus drivers, health workers. The actual numbers seemed small, but those fifty MDR \n[a form of tuberculosis that does not respond to standard treatment] cases represented about 10 percent of all \nactive cases of TB in the slum, about ten times more than might have been expected. No telling how many \nothers they had been infecting as they'd traveled around Lima, coughing. No telling either how many people in \nother parts of the city already had MDR, but [there were] reports of hundreds in other neighborhoods. In \nCarabayllo itself, the Socios workers found entire families sick and dying with what turned out to be genetically \nrelated strains of the disease--a phenomenon common enough that the health workers gave it a name, familias \ntebeceanas, tuberculosis families. \nKim's organization confronted Peru's MDR-form tuberculosis epidemic with what some have called unorthodox \npractices -- borrowing and cajoling its way into medicine for its patients. \nHoward Hiatt, a friend of Jim Yong Kim's and a former dean at the Harvard School of Public Health, said he \nwas concerned about how PIH was getting medicine to combat the epidemic: \n\"Sure enough. Paul and Jim would stop at the [Harvard-affiliated] Brigham pharmacy before they left for Peru \nand fill their briefcases with drugs. They had sweet-talked various people into letting them walk away with the \ndrugs.\" [Hiatt] was amused, all in all. \"That's their Robin Hood attitude.\" In fact, they'd only borrowed the \ndrugs... \nThen one day the president of the Brigham stopped Hiatt in a corridor. \"Your friends Farmer and Kim are in \ntrouble with me. They owe this hospital ninety-two thousand dollars.\" Hiatt looked into the matter. \"Sure \nenough. Paul and Jim would stop at the Brigham pharmacy before they left for Peru and fill their briefcases with \ndrugs. They had sweet-talked various people into letting them walk away with the drugs.\" He was amused, all in \nall. \"That's their Robin Hood attitude.\" \nTo many seasoned managers of public health projects, what Farmer and Kim were doing would have looked \nquite reckless--like a stunt, as some would later insinuate. They didn't have a guaranteed supply of drugs, only \nthe determination to obtain the drugs and the charm to get away with borrowing. They were borrowing their \nlaboratory services, too, from Massachusetts. They lacked proper institutional support. The weight of expert \nopinion stood against them. Their organization was small and it had other projects, in Haiti and Boston and \nelsewhere, and Peru put a strain on everyone. Jim had to travel to Carabayllo at least once a month. Farmer had \nto go there slightly more often. \nKim's audacious 'Robin Hood attitude' won him and PIH acclaim for their role in changing global health and \ndevelopment. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013461 \nIn June 2002 ... the WHO adopted new prescriptions for dealing with MDR-TB, virtually the same as PIH had \nused in Carabayllo. For Jim Kim this marked the end of a long campaign. \"The world changed yesterday,\" he \nwrote from Geneva to all of PIH. The prices of second-line antibiotics continued to decline, and the drugs now \nflowed fairly smoothly through the Green Light Committee to, among other places, Peru, where about 1,000 \nchronic patients were either cured or in treatment. About 250 were receiving the drugs in Tomsk, and, largely \nbecause of the efforts of WHO, the Russian Ministry of Health had finally agreed to the terms of the World \nBank's TB loan--150 million dollars to begin to fight the epidemic throughout the country. \nThe twin pandemics of AIDS and tuberculosis raged on, of course, magnifying each other, in Africa and Asia, \nEastern Europe and Latin America. Mathematical models predicted widening global catastrophe--100 million \nHIV infections in the world by the year 2010. Some prominent voices, some in the U.S. government, still \nargued that AIDS could not be treated in desperately impoverished places. But this view seemed to be fading. \nThe prices of antiretrovirals were falling, even more dramatically than the prices of second-line TB drugs. \nThis was thanks to a growing worldwide campaign for treating AIDS wherever it occurred. Jim Kim had often \nsaid that the world's response to AIDS and TB would define the moral standing of his generation. In 2003, a \nnew director general took over at WHO, and he asked Jim to serve as his senior adviser. Meanwhile, the \nexample of Zanmi Lasante [PIH's Haiti-based project] was growing, and Cange had become a favorite \ndestination for global health policy makers and American politicians. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013462 \n",

Bush's executive \norder that - with the exception of a handful of existing stem cell lines - prohibited federal funding of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) \nresearch. \nSpecial Report - Stem Cell Research under Horizon 2020 \nStem Cell Research in Horizon 2020: Experts debate what Europe must do to maintain its lead in regenerative medicine  \nThe view from the US: Stem cell therapy steps up a gear with first approval and improved political climate  \nView from Europe: Delivering on the vision of regenerative medicine and stem cells  \nTalking to the experts: Why the EU should support human embryonic stem cell research in Horizon 2020  \nOVERVIEW: Regenerate the future - human embryonic stem cell research is crucial to deliver health and growth  \nThis easing of restrictions on hESC research was expected to engender enough confidence to attract investors into the space and \nencourage pharmaceutical and biotech companies to build robust product pipelines based on stem cell therapies. However, a tougher \nregulatory climate for biopharmaceuticals in general and a protracted legal challenge to the relaxing of rules on hESCs has served to \nkeep both big pharma companies and venture capitalists on the sidelines to date. \nNevertheless, there has been progress, particularly at the research end of the development spectrum. Three and a half years on stem \ncells are no longer high on the political agenda as they once were. This speaks to the generally positive public acceptance of stem cell \nresearch in the US. A Research!America poll of likely voters in the presidential election, conducted in August 2012, found that 61 per \ncent of prospective voters were in favor of expanding funding for hESC research. \nInvestor interest \nLooking back over his first term in office Obama can point to some major gains. These include funding increases for the National \nInstitutes of Health's (NIH) stem cell initiatives, and greater investor interest in the wider field of regenerative medicine including the use \nof adult stem cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. \nHowever, it hasn't all been smooth sailing. Although after protracted forethought, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave the \ngreen light for the Californian biotech Geron to begin the very first human clinical trial of a human embryonic stem cell-derived therapy \nin January 2009, the trial has not been without its problems. \nThe Phase I trial, treating patients with acute spinal cord injury, was hit with an FDA clinical hold causing significant delays to its \ninitiation in 2010. A year later, after 15 years' effort, the Geron washed its hands of the programme, blaming its withdrawal from the \nstem cell space on capital scarcity and uncertain economic conditions. The decision wiped out a leading player in hESC translation and \ncommercialisation. However, the regenerative medicine sector has been able to recover and is beginning to blossom. (See Public \nMarkets section below). The prime movers in the Geron trial are now attempting to revive it. \nResearch funding robust \nFederal funding for all forms of stem cell research has increased over the past four years. However, the NIH funding component for \nhESC has been dogged by litigation for the past three years. In Sherley v. Sebelius, researchers James Sherley and Theresa Deisher, \nwho worked with adult stem cells, claimed the NIH guidelines violated the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal \nfunds for research in which human embryos are destroyed or discarded. This overhang was not finally removed until August 2012 when \na three-judge panel from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld the NIH 2009 guidelines that \npermit funding of hESC research. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013482 \nThrough its Common Fund the NIH has established the Center for Regenerative Medicine (NIH CRM), to support this field, with the \ngoal of accelerating the translation of stem cell-based clinical therapies. \nState funding filling the void \nWith stem cell research in general not attracting a significant amount of venture funding, the California Institute of Regenerative \nMedicine (CIRM), which was established in 2004 with $3 billion for stem cell research at California universities and research institutions, \nhas begun to fill the void left by traditional venture capital firms. To date CIRM has allocated $150 million in funding to help move \npromising stem cell-based therapies from the bench into clinical trials. \n'We are a lot closer to having promising therapies ready for clinical trials, so it makes sense that we step up our engagement with \nindustry to help fund those trials and move those therapies closer to approval by the FDA,\" said Duane Roth, vice chair of the governing \nboard of CIRM. \nCIRM's funding for translational research is good news for biotech companies, providing them with a source of funds in a field where it \nremains challenging to raise private capital. \nThree biotech companies have been funded so far under CIRM's Strategic Partnership Awards initiative. A grant of $10.1 million was \nawarded to ViaCyte Inc. to continue preclinical research and initiate clinical testing of an embryonic stem cell-based therapy for patients \nwith insulin-dependent diabetes. \nMeanwhile, Bluebird Bio Inc. will use a $9.3 million grant to support a Phase I/II study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LentiGlobin, \nthe company's programme for the treatment of the inherited blood disorder beta-thalassemia, which will be initiated in the US in 2013. \nStemCells Inc. has been awarded up to $20 million to fund preclinical development of its product consisting of purified human neural \nstem cells for treating Alzheimer's disease, with the goal of filing for permission to carry out a clinical trial in that time. In July, CIRM \napproved a separate award to the company for up to $20 million to fund preclinical development of a cell therapy for spinal cord injury. \nPublic Markets \nIt has been a good year for stem cell companies on the public markets, with the thirteen publicly-listed stem cell companies showing an \naverage increase in share price of 11.6 percent in the year-to-date. \nThis boost came from a regulatory approval and positive clinical trials results. It was a big breakthrough for the field as a whole when \nthe Canadian regulator Health Canada approved Prochymal, Osiris Therapeutics Inc.'s allogeneic stem cell treatment for graft-vs.-host \ndisease (GvHD) in children. \nThe decision marked the world's first regulatory approval of a manufactured stem cell product and the first therapy approved for GvHD \n— a devastating complication of bone marrow transplantation that kills up to 80 percent of children affected, many within just weeks of \ndiagnosis. The company's stock value has almost doubled in the course of this year. \nMeanwhile, Newark, California-based StemCells, Inc. has seen its shares rise 148 per cent in the year to date. In addition to its CIRM \ngrants, the company recently reported clinical and preclinical data demonstrating the therapeutic potential of a cell therapy for treating \nmyelination disorders. \nPluristem Therapeutics Inc.'s stock value also has jumped 44 per cent, on the strength of reporting a single case study in wh ich a \npatient with aplastic bone marrow who received an intramuscular injection of its PLacental eXpanded cells under compassionate use \nsaw an improvement. The company was also able to successfully complete a public offering which netted about US$30 million. \nPositive clinical trials will begin to encourage investment \nWhile still in their early stages of development - and with clinical trials having only involved a limited number of patients - reports to date \nhave been very promising, and provide further validation for encouraging investment in stem cell therapeutics. For example, data from a \nhuman embryonic stem cell trial conducted by Advanced Cell Technology and published in medical journal The Lancet, showed that \ntwo patients with Stargardt's disease, a degenerative eye condition, had regained some vision. \nIn addition, positive early data from a spinal cord injury trial involving StemCells' neural stem cells indicated that two patients with no \nfeeling below the site of injury were able to regain sensation, while in another study from the company, patients with a rare myelination \ndisorder were able to create myelin, an advance that holds promise for treating multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy. \nThis scientific progress has helped breath a new sense of optimism into the US stem cell sector. The Fiscal Cliff apart, it seems likely \nthis momentum will continue now Obama has secured a second term. \nPeter Winter is a writer, editor and analyst on the global biotechnology industry.

Yes, banks/financials \nmight pull back at some point after this run-up but we would be buyers on any pullbacks and we continue to see further \nupside from multiple expansion and earnings growth. Our analyst raised her price targets by —11% across the board. The \nlong term rotation from bonds and div stocks into sectors like financials is only beginning. \nVol is higher on the week; what prices well now: \nBuy the XLF March 2017 $22 call with $26 Knock-Out (continuous) for $0.87, with a full premium \nrebate if knock-out occurs. \nThis prices attractively given flat call skew and if XLF breaches $26 and this knocks out, at least you get your \npremium back. \nPlease find our Financials report attached. \nFuture of Financials conference hosted 90 public and private companies at our Future of Financials conference. We are \nraising our price objectives across most of our names. Three primary reasons why we think there is upside remaining \nafter the recent rally: 1) an improved outlook on both activity levels and interest rates, driving revenue upside; 2) \npotentially lower regulatory burden, particularly as new supervisory leadership can come with the new administration; \nand 3) relatively lighter positioning in US financials vs. other sectors. (Erika Najarian) \nFrom: Ens, Amanda \nSent: Monday, November 14, 2016 12:05 PM \nTo: 'Jeffrey E.'; 'Richard Kahn' \nSubject: RE: Financials trade for Monday \nWe continue to see buyers of XLF today. Funds are underweight financials in all regions, valuations are \nreasonable, earnings are improving and financials tend to outperform when bond yields rise. \nVol is higher today — refreshed pricing below. \nBuy an XLF 17March2017 call spread: \n• Buy the 105% call / sell a 110% call with a 115% at-expiry knock-in \n• Total premium: 1.86% \nGlobal Positioning in Stocks: Nigel Tupper notes the 4000 funds in our \"Positioning in Stocks\" analysis  \nare more underweight Financials, on average, than any other sector and are underweight this sector in all \nregions of the world. If earnings continue to improve and yield rise, which is often the case in an upturn in our \nGlobal Wave, then the unloved Financials sector has the potential to continue to outperform. \nGlobal Quant Panorama: \"Bearish on Bonds\" stocks (which tend to move in the opposite direction to  \nbond yields) tend to outperform our \"Bullish On Bonds\" when bond yields rise. The sectors that tend to \nperform best as bond yields rise are Energy, Tech, Materials, Banks, and Diversified Financials. Of these \nsectors, the laggards this year have been Banks and Diversified Financials. With a PE of 15.9x and a PB of \n2.0x, Global valuations are reasonable. Also, Risk is near all-time lows in terms of PE in most regions. Now \nthat macro and earnings data have triggered the beginning of a rotation, Value becomes very relevant. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014312 \nFrom: Ens, Amanda \nSent: Friday, November 11, 2016 4:04 PM \nTo: 'jeffrey E.'; 'Richard Kahn' \nSubject: Financials trade for Monday \nIt's not too late to buy financials as a medium term trade. They've run up a lot this week but we're getting \nendless calls from generalists asking which banks to buy — there is still more upside to the sector. Banks also \nprovide some offset to your bonds if interest rates continue to move. Our financials sector specialist thinks XLF \ncould have another 20-25% upside given its many levers to the Trump trade: less regulation, higher interest \nrates/steeper yield curve, higher vol, economic growth, etc. The regional banks are asset sensitive and more of a \npure play on a rates move but we view the larger cap banks as having even more upside to the Trump Trade \ngiven the above points. \nBuy an XLF 17March2017 call spread: \n• Buy the 105% call / sell a 110% call with a 115% at-expiry knock-in \n• Total premium: 1.75% \nAll eyes are on Sunday's 60 Minutes interview with Trump. Market is pricing that all regulations will be rolled \nback (very optimistic). Any hint that this is not true could lead to pullback on Monday. \nNote on tech: we're seeing FANG used as a source of funds with the rotation from growth into value. There's \nalso the tax read-through: tech is already relatively tax advantaged @ 22%; Industrials are at 30%, Financials at \n29%. Next year, tech could benefit from a repatriation tax holiday but that is viewed as more of a Q1/Q2 trade. \nMore thoughts on financials: \nWith respect to the economy, the market is certainly indicating that there will be a large fiscal stimulus which \nmay send US growth higher and that's a good thing for financials for a wide variety of reasons, from \nemployment to wages to loan growth and credit quality (even if somewhat offset by higher rates). It does \nremain to be seen exactly how much of this expected policy actually gets done, but at the moment, investors are \nwilling to take a certain amount of growth on faith. \nSo those are positives for financials before we even discuss regulation. The move in the financials since the \nelection would seem to indicate that investors have concluded that nearly every piece of financial regulation \nwill get put into a shredder on day one of the new administration. The incoming administration has fueled that \nwith comments about rolling back pieces (or more) of Dodd-Frank in particular. I can see making the case for \nthat to the American public by saying that banks need less regulation in order to get more capital flowing into \nthe economy to drive growth. Not only does that mean that the E is likely too low (meaning that the P/E is not \nas high as it seems) but it could help improve ROE's as well which could increase the multiple of that higher E \ninvestors are willing to pay. Note that while ROEs could go higher, it's unlikely that they can get back to the \npeaks... \nRegards, \nAmanda \nAmanda Ens \nDirector \nBank of America Merrill Lynch \nMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated \nOne Bryant Park, 5th Floor, New York, NY 10036 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014313 \nThe power of global connectionsTm \nBankofAmerica<s-ss-40* \nMerrill Lynch \nThis message, and any attachments, is for the intended recipient(s) only, may contain information that is \nprivileged, confidential and/or proprietary and subject to important terms and conditions available at \nhttp://www.bankofamerica.com/emaildisclaimer.

Risk is diplomacy, protectionism, and \nUS economic cycle \nFULL REPORT \nBullish equities 2017; rotation into cyclicals, banks, insurance \nWe are bullish Japan equities for 2017 and we estimate the Nikkei 225 index will recover to 20,000 by end-\n2017 (see $/¥'s eventual surge: Buy Nikkei 06 September 2016). Our new Chief Japan Economist lzumi \nDevalier forecasts above-consensus Japan GDP growth and inflation in 2017, which is also supportive of our \nbullish equities scenario (see 4.eady for ignition 18 November 2016). We expect rotation into cyclicals, banks \nand insurance as explained below. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014399 \n1) Upturn in inventory cycle: Defensives—>Cyclicals \nWe expect cyclicals to outperform defensives, premised on our end-2017 $114 estimate of ¥120, and this is \nsupported by our above-consensus economic growth outlook. Our Japan economist sees a shift to fiscal \neasing, firms countering the tight labor market by increasing capex, and estimates industrial production to grow \n3.5% and 3.6% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. With the inventory cycle exiting a \"contraction\" phase and \nentering a \"recovery\" phase, conditions are likely to remain conducive to cyclicals outperforming defensives \n(Chart 1, Exhibit 3). \n2) Higher inflation, rates: Deflation stocks—>lnflation stocks \nUp to 1H16, the Japan equity market saw continued preference for deflationary stocks as domestic inflation \nremained subdued and the JGB curve underwent excessive bull flattening. Defensives outperformed cyclicals \n(Chart 1), growth outperformed value (Chart 2), and stocks that benefit from a low-yield environment (REITs) \noutperformed the converse (banks, insurance; Chart 3). However, we expect conditions to reverse into 2017. \nWe see US Treasury yields rising and Japanese core CPI inflation recovering to +1.4% yoy by 2018 and core-\ncore to +1.1% yoy. Stronger inflation and higher foreign yields should steepen the JGB yield curve above10yr, \nwhile below 10yr should escape from downward pressure as BoJ rate cut expectations recede. Against this \nbackdrop, we expect to see a rotation from deflation to inflation stocks, which in addition to cyclicals means \nbanks and insurance should outperform REITs within the financial sector (Chart 3). This is also in line with the \nglobal rotation expected by Michael Hartnett (The Flow Show: The inflation Era Begins 10 Noverriper 2016). \n3) Nikkei winner of steeper UST and strong macro \nIn a scenario of strong external demand and US rate hikes (particularly with curve steepening), Japan equities \ntend to be the winner on a local currency basis, led by cyclicals, banks and insurance stocks (Exhibit 4). \nResurgence in the \"Japan macro trade\" of short yen / buy equities is also a possibility. \nOur Buy-rated stocks in bank, insurance and cyclical sectors are listed in Table 1. \nShusuke Yamada, CFA \nFX/Equity Strategist \nMerrill Lynch (Japan) \nGlobal Research \nBankof America \nMerrill Lynch \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014400 \nJapan Economics Viewpoint \nReady for ignition  \n18 November 2016 \nKey takeaways \n• We are upbeat on Japan's outlook and think consensus is underestimating the strength of \nmedium-term GDP and inflation. \n• While the consensus looks for just 0.8% growth next year, we expect growth of 1.4% in \nCY17 and 1.2% in CY18. \n• With inflation moving in the right direction, we expect BoJ to keep its rates targets \nunchanged for the foreseeable future. \nWATCH THE VIDEO  \nFULL REPORT \nConsensus underestimating GDP and inflation \nWe are upbeat on Japan's outlook and think consensus is underestimating the strength of medium-term GDP \nand inflation. We expect growth of 1.4% in CY2017 and 1.2% in CY2018, well above consensus of just 0.8% \ngrowth next year. For the first time in four years both monetary and fiscal policy are supporting growth. The \ncombination of modestly higher commodity prices, a weaker yen, and a tightening output gap should drive \nJapan-style core inflation to 1.0% in CY2017, and 1.4% in CY2018. We expect the BoJ to keep its rate targets \nunchanged for the foreseeable future as inflation moves in the right direction. \nFiscal and monetary policy realigning \nFor years Japan has oscillated between loose and tight fiscal policy. Japanese policymakers now seem to be \non the same page and we see little risk of another policy error. If anything, we see upside risks from greater \nfiscal stimulus via a third supplementary budget or a relatively aggressive FY17 ordinary budget. Meanwhile, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014401 \nthe BoJ's new interest-pegging regime ensures that financial conditions will become increasingly stimulatory \nas inflation rises. \n2017 - a year of recovering domestic demand \nWe think the economy is heading towards a cyclical sweet spot and see a broad-based recovery in domestic \ndemand. Specifically, 1) consumption is poised to rebound as the saving rate peaks; 2) capex should \naccelerate in response to the improving demand outlook, deepening supply-side constraints, and \"low-for-\nlonger\" real rates; and 3) increased efforts by policymakers to accelerate income redistribution could push up \nthe velocity of money at the margin, helping to reflate the economy. \nBiggest risk factor: US policy uncertainty \nExternal developments pose the greatest risk to our forecasts, chief among them US policy uncertainty. The \ndownside scenario for Japan is a combination of rising US protectionism, sliding global trade, and a stronger \nyen, which could reduce 2017 growth to zero. The Trump presidency may increase pressure on Japan to \nachieve greater military self-reliance, boosting defense spending. There will also be greater incentives to \ndeepen economic and trade linkages with key regional players, such as China and Russia. \nChart 1: We think consensus is underestimating the strength of medium-term GDP and inflation \n2.0 \n1.6 - \n1.0 '9'7 0.6 \n1111  -0.3 -0.3 \n0.5 - \n0.0 \nReal GDP %YoY 4 CPI ex fresh food %YoY / \n........................................................................./  ' \n/ 0 \n-0.5 \n04 \nCY1 6 CY1 7 CY1 CY16 CY17 CY1 3 \n• BofANIL Consensus (Bloomberg, as of 15 Nov 2016) \nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch forecasts, Bloomberg \nlzumi Devalier \nJapan Economist \nMerrill Lynch (Japan) \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014402 \nBank of America \nMerrill Lynch \n2017 Institutional Investor (All-Japan) Survey \nYour Vote Counts - We appreciate your support \nClick here to vote \nBank of America \nMerrill Lynch \nRead the research report for complete information including important disclosures and analyst certification(s). \nThe research report and the link to such report are for the use of Bank of America Merrill Lynch customers only or Merrill Lynch \nGlobal Wealth Management customers only and all copying, redistribution, retransmission, publication, and any other \ndissemination or use of the contents thereof are prohibited.

Renewed investor confidence. Bond markets under \npressure. Our Chief Investment Office explores the risks and opportunities of \nthese and other trends shaping the year ahead. \nAS WE \nLOOK \nBACK ON \n2016, one \ncould \ncharacterize \nit as The \nYear of The \nUnlikely. It began with deep worries regarding China's growth path, a second wave of collapsing \noil prices, a Federal Reserve (Fed) hiking into deflationary headwinds, the impact of negative \ninterest rates in Europe and Japan, concerns over a potential U.S. recession, lower-quality corporate \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014525 \nhigh yield problems, and U.S. consumers who might never spend their savings at the pump. All \nthese worries hit at once in January and February, prompting the S&P 500 to fall over 10% from its \n2015 closing level of 2043. The year, at that point, appeared bleak. \nOur view was to maintain a balanced and diversified position throughout the downturn, particularly \nfor the long haul, due to our belief that the major concerns, although understandable, were simply \nnot going to fully develop and asset prices would begin to track fundamentals more effectively \nthrough the remainder of the year. The potential for risk assets to climb higher was there but a \ncatalyst was needed. For our full view on the year ahead, please read our December 2016 Monthly  \nLetter.  \nExhibit 1: Mid-Cycle Slowdown Ended In Early 2016, \nWhen Oil and Dollar Stabilized) \n120 \nSpot 01 Price: West Texas Incernwdlate \n_.(6-Alowth Moving erage.

Data as of December 5, 2016. \n96 \n92 \n88 \n84 \nPast performance is no guarantee offuture results. \nOur core belief was centered on healthy consumers who would indeed pick up their spending from \nsavings at the pump and become more confident as job growth continued and real incomes \nincreased. We also believed U.S. financial conditions and the economic backdrop would improve in \nthe second half of the year as the pressure from the strong dollar subsided and the deflationary \neffects of the collapse in oil prices began to fade. In other words, we were witnessing evidence that \nthe mid-cycle slowdown that had hurt economic growth and corporate earnings was ending. [See \nExhibit 1] Based on this core belief, the \"grind it out\" year for risk assets would be back on track, \nthe business cycle would extend into 2017, bond yields would slowly shift higher, and equity \nmarkets had the potential to head toward previous highs. \nA series of unexpected outcomes \nAt this point, we did not characterize 2016 as The Year of the Unlikely. However, if you consider \nspecific events throughout the year in finance and sports, it is easy to see that now. We already \nmentioned the second plunge in oil prices to the mid-$20s per barrel to start the year, and bond \nmarkets in some areas of the world actually had negative yields—meaning the lender paid the \nentity issuing the bonds to take their money! This was unlikely. How about Brexit vote in Great \nBritain? Unlikely. In sports, Villanova University winning the national championship in men's \ncollege basketball (Nova's first championship since 1985), Leicester—the English football club—\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014526 \nwinning the Premier League (before this season began, British bookmakers listed them as a 5,000-\nto-1 shot to emerge as the champion), the Cleveland Cavaliers' first ever National Basketball \nAssociation championship and, of course, the Chicago Cubs winning the World Series for the first \ntime since 1908! All unlikely. But they happened. \nLast but not least, in our own political backyard, we witnessed Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. \npresidential election last month. Also unlikely. We all know markets do not like uncertainty. \nHowever, sentiment can shift quickly if fundamentals are not negatively affected, and what was \npreviously determined to be \"unlikely\" turns to enthusiasm as to what could be. \n\"We expect business, consumer and investor confidence to continue to head \nhigher well into 2017, with most of the newly expected growth to come in 2018, \nwhich should underpin equities for most of the year.\" \nCHRISTOPHER HYZY \nCHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BANK OF AMERICA GLOBAL WEALTH AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT \nWhy this expansion can continue \nBusiness cycles typically last between five and seven years before fundamentals deteriorate, \nusually due to a policy error of some sort. This can produce a recession and/or a bear market, which \ntend to correct the excesses that have been built up and kick-start a new cycle. Bull markets and \ncycles do not die of old age—there needs to be a fundamental catalyst that emerges and pushes the \ntrends back the other way. \nWe are entering our ninth year in the current business cycle, despite all of the complexities and \nconcerns that have come and gone since the financial crisis.. In fact, this cycle could have extended \nanother few years along the same path, given the secular stagnation that prevailed. This era needed \nultra-accommodative central bank monetary policy just to keep things stable and plodding along \nthis far into the cycle. It also needed corporations willing to manage their earnings to the penny in a \nbelow trend growth world that offered little pricing power. And finally, this cycle needed U.S. and \nemerging market consumers to continue to switch from deleveraging to spending as their balance \nsheets and incomes improved. \nA return of \"animal spirits\" \nThis dynamic could have continued for a bit, but monetary policy has become tired. Negative \ninterest rates have become a headwind, not a tailwind, in our view. And, just like sports fans, \ninvestors need a catalyst to break from the past. Visible positive catalysts tend to turn into \nimproved sentiment and confidence. Through the years, economists have called this \"animal \nspirits.\" \nAnimal spirits begin as hope, turn into enthusiasm, and ultimately need visible action to keep the \nspirited momentum going. After all, economics is a behavioral science. It is our view that we are \nbreaking from the era of secular stagnation and heading into fiscal reflation. This new era is likely \nto have its fits and starts and will not be in a straight line. It should also include different stages and \nspeeds from various economic regions globally. Furthermore, it should contain some \"unlikely\" \noutcomes. With any cycle, we will have to take the good (higher nominal growth) with the potential \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014527 \nbad (higher volatility) and investors will have to reposition portfolios, rebalancing when necessary, \nin order to take advantage of the new era. \nPrior to the U.S. presidential election, and even dating back to the summer months when bond \nyields bottomed, the economy was already beginning to improve. Corporate earnings were picking \nup, the consumer was spending at a healthy clip, there were some subtle signs of positive surprises \nin European economic activity, and the downturn in emerging markets (and negative earnings \nrevisions) ceased. We were certainly not waving the celebratory flag on growth, but the economy \nwas getting up off the ground, which is what risk assets, including equities, need sometimes. \nHowever, the S&P 500—a major benchmark for U.S. stocks--had lost momentum heading into the \nelection, as investors worried that the secular stagnation era would continue and that monetary \npolicy had lost its effectiveness. \nMarket sentiment changed dramatically during the early morning hours on November 9. The \nsurprise victory by Donald Trump caught many investors off-guard. The potential for fiscal \nstimulus measures, reduced regulation, corporate tax reform and other potential pro-growth \ninitiatives increased. Animal spirits perked up. Investor positioning was heavily skewed toward \nlong-duration fixed income, low-volatility equities and high-dividend-paying companies. These \nareas significantly outperformed in the first half of the year but started to lose momentum once \nrates bottomed mid-year. However, investor positioning did not change materially at first. \nPortfolios were still generally overexposed to higher- quality, rate-sensitive investments—\notherwise known as \"bond proxies.\" \nIn our Hills Have Eyes strategy report, published on November 16, we outlined the need to \nrebalance portfolios given our belief that we were already transitioning toward the late-cycle \nexpansion phase and that the new enthusiasm for pro-growth policies would begin to accelerate \ninvestor flows toward more cyclical investments. Given the high degree of underexposure to late-\ncycle investments by investors, we believed such a rotation would cause a \"melt-up\" in equities \ntoward new highs over time. \nDiversification and rebalancing will be key \nSo, how are we going to manage portfolios in a world undergoing a major market regime shift, one \nthat is transitioning from the era of secular stagnation to fiscal reflation, and one that still has a \nconsiderable amount of uncertainty? We are going to become more prescriptive, remain diversified \nand balanced, but with more exposure to pro-growth, pro-cyclical areas. We will also likely \nrebalance more often throughout the year as investor rotation gathers momentum during 2017 and \ninto 2018; and we look to periods of volatility as opportunities to add to areas we favor. \n\"Fixed income still represents an important portfolio diversifier___and a volatility \ndampener in unforeseen worst-case scenarios.\" \nCHRISTOPHER HYZY \nCHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BANK OF AMERICA GLOBAL WEALTH AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT \nWe expect business, consumer and investor confidence to continue to head higher well into 2017, \nwith most of the newly expected growth to come in 2018, which should underpin equities for most \nof the year. Higher nominal growth, an improved picture for corporate profits and continued \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014528 \npositive sentiment are the foundation for continued gains in the equity markets and an investor \nrotation from overexposure to long-dated fixed income into under owned equities. \nThis rotation will need a few periods of confirmation, given the still uncertain broader global macro \noutlook, but we expect price-to-earnings multiples to remain elevated, despite higher rates, \nthroughout the year. S&P 500 earnings have a wide range of forecasts due to the potential for \nsizable tax cuts in 2017. Based on this, the S&P 500 could add extra earnings on top of normalized \ngrowth, which is expected to be around 9%. At present, a reasonable range, albeit a wide one, is \nconsidered to be between $129 and $138 with the potential for further upside. In this scenario, \nwhere we get pro-growth policies filtering into a higher earnings number, an S&P 500 bull case \nlevel of 2700 at the high end is possible. \nImproving profits and growth should take equities higher \nFor now, a base case utilizing the five factor framework from BofA Merrill Lynch Global \nResearch, which combines sentiment, valuation and technical, equates to 2300 for the S&P 500 at \nyear end. The two components that include long-term valuation and 12-month price momentum are \nindicating that S&P 500 levels between the base and bull case are increasing in probability. Of \ncourse, there are a number of scenarios that could unfold that would indicate a wide range of \noutcomes depending on the multiple or earnings number that ultimately develops. In the end, it all \ncomes down to the path of corporate profits and the visibility on growth, both of which are \nimproving. \nHighlights \u000bWe have moved from a \"get paid to wait\" core \u000bportfolio theme to a more cyclical- and value-\u000boriented theme in multi-asset portfolios \u000b• Equities remain attractive versus fixed income \u000bon a relative basis. \n• Within equities. we favor U.S. large caps. U.S. \u000bsmall caps and emerging markets. \n• Within equities, we favor value over growth and \u000bmore cyclical assets versus defensives. \n• Within fixed income. we prefer credit to Treasuries. \u000bWe would also consider an allocation to Treasury \u000binflation protected securities (TIPS) where appropriate. \nPortfolio repositioning is likely to continue well into 2017, as developments unfold and the pro-\ncyclical environment gathers momentum. With growth already heading higher from Q3 2016 \nonward and earnings turning positive, investors have begun increasing cyclicality and exposure to \nvalue in portfolios at the expense of more defensive sectors and higher-dividend areas within \nequities. In addition, we expect a larger shift in emphasis toward small capitalization, which has \nalready started, and more domestic-oriented equities due to a slightly stronger dollar, more pro-\ngrowth policies and the desire for a hedge against potential retaliatory trade policies from main \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014529 \ntrading partners. This portfolio shift in positioning is happening but, in our view, is in its early \nstages. \nWe have moved from a \"get paid to wait\" core portfolio theme to a more cyclical and value-\noriented theme in multi-asset and all-equity portfolios primarily due to increased business and \nconsumer confidence, which should lead to higher earnings than originally expected. \n• Therefore, we have raised our exposure to equities versus fixed income to a moderate overweight and our new tactical \nasset allocation view is overweight equities versus its strategic benchmark. \n• We are now further underweight fixed income versus equities, underweight versus its strategic benchmark rather than \nneutral, and have lowered cash to neutral from overweight. \nWithin the asset classes, we have made a number of changes consistent with our view from earlier \nthis year and one that has accelerated post-election. \n• We are now moderately overweight U.S. small capitalization equities and neutral non-U.S. developed markets. \n• We maintain our preference for U.S. high-quality large caps and continue to overweight emerging markets. \n• We continue to favor value over growth and more cyclical areas (such as financials and consumer discretionary) versus \ndefensives (such as utilities and consumer staples). \nIn fixed income, we have moved from a balanced view to a larger underweight versus the strategic \nbenchmark. \n• However, fixed income still represents an important portfolio diversifier___and a volatility dampener in unforeseen \nworst-case scenarios___and should be viewed primarily as a cash flow producer versus a total return asset, given the expectations \nfor higher yields. \n• In addition, we have lowered Treasuries to a further underweight but maintain our neutral rating on high yield and \nunderweight on international fixed income. \n• Municipal bonds have corrected to levels that are becoming attractive again, and we are still favorable on investment \ngrade corporate credit. \n• We maintain our neutral rating on real estate and commodities, but we prefer metals and oil to gold. \nIn addition, the pro-cyclical improvement has started to break down the elevated correlation among \nand within asset classes since earlier in 2016. We expect this adjustment to continue in 2017 as \neconomic volatility picks up and asset class volatility follows suit. Transitions to late-cycle phases \ntend to invite a higher level of volatility as inflation rises and central bank policies shift to nudging \nshort rates higher. \nIn this environment, alternative investments, namely hedge funds, should outperform industry \nbenchmarks, in contrast to recent underperformance. For investors able to withstand a higher \nallocation of illiquid assets in their portfolio, we prefer timberland for its long term-growth \nprospects and low correlation to financial assets. \nPaul V.

[jeeyacation@gmail.com]; Richard Kahn \nSubject: Meet with our Global Head of Commodities - Monday at 10:15am at One Bryant Park \nAttachments: image001.png \nImportance: High \nPlease let me know if you're interested in joining a small group meeting with our head of Global Commodities. Apologies \nfor the short notice but they just created this based on client request. \n• Monday, January 30 at 10:15am at One Bryant Park (42nd St & 6th Ave), Room 5F \nFrancisco Blanch is a managing director and head of Global Commodities and Derivatives Research. Regular Research \npublications include: The Global Energy Weekly, Commodity Portfolio Monthly and Quantitative Investment Strategies \nMonthly. Research produced by the Commodities, Asset Allocation, and Global Derivatives teams has been recognized \nby Institutional Investor, Extel, Greenwich, Bloomberg, or Energy Risk, among others. Previously he was Head of Global \nAsset Allocation Research. Prior to joining Merrill Lynch, Blanch was an energy economist focusing on global oil & gas in \nthe commodity research group at Goldman Sachs & Co. and consulted for the European Commission and other public \nand private organizations. Blanch has a masters degree in public administration from Harvard University and a \ndoctorate in economics from Complutense University of Madrid. \nKey topics of discussion: \n1 — OPEC / Saudi Policy - OPEC agreed to cut production by 1.2mb/d, along with 600kb/d from non-OPEC \nproducers. Francisco believes Saudi's key objective will be to push the oil forward curve into backwardation to 1)lower \nglobal refinery margins 2) lower prices for forward sellers and prevent capex spending 3) reduce downside oil price \nrisks. Francisco believes it is in OPEC's best interest to comply with the stated cuts, and thins Saudi remains under \nsignificant pressure to either achieve higher oil prices, or inevitably de-peg the Riyal. \n2 - Oil fundamentals - OPEC's cut has significant implications for supply/demand balances and throws the global market \ninto a meaningful deficit for 2017. We estimate the global market will be in a 560kb/d deficit throughout 2017. US \nShale output remains a headwind for a rebound in global balances and will vary with price. Given our $59/bbl 2017 \noutlook for WTI, Francisco believes shale will reverse its current trend before rebounding sequentially by 660kb/d \nbetween 2Q17 and 4Q17. \n3 — US Energy Policy / Trump Administration — Francisco views the likelihood for Trump's administration to implement a \nborder adjustment tax to be extremely low, but recognizes that if a tax was imposed, it would have profound \nimplications for EM demand and the WTI/Br arb. The appointment of key cabinet members Rex Tillerson, Rick Perry, \nand Scott Pruitt pose significant implications for the US energy sector. \n4 — Commodity Macro — Forward inflation expectations around the world have jumped sharply since Trump's \nvictory. So far, rising inflation and steeper yield curves have neutralized the strong dollar, pushing commodities \nhigher. We believe the recent breakdown in USD/Oil correlation since OPEC/Fed can persist so long as inflation \nexpectations remain supported. However, a toxic mix of much faster-than-anticipated US interest rate hikes, a much \nstronger USD, and a trade war with China pose risks. \nAmanda Ens \nDirector \nBank of America Merrill Lynch \nMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated \nOne Bryant Park, 5th Floor, New York, NY 10036 \nPhone: Mobile: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014695 \nThe power of global connectionsTm \nBankof America -Irritr.' \nMerrill Lynch \nThis message, and any attachments, is for the intended recipient(s) only, may contain information that is \nprivileged, confidential and/or proprietary and subject to important terms and conditions available at \nhttp://www.bankofamerica.com/emaildisclaimer.

Obamacare difficult with \nonly 52 seats in the Senate but Ryan has gone too far to back away from ACA and refocus on tax reform as a priority. \nMcConnell's ACA target is mid-April and then they can start to focus on tax reform 2H April at the earliest. \n• Position for a market pullback over the next 6-8 weeks on bad headlines, data rollover (consumer confidence) \nas market focuses on ACA, low approval ratings and lack of progress with tax reform — \nbuy early- or mid-May expiries \nvol and SPX puts are cheap — \n• Still long term bullish \n• 95% tax reform still happens this year (2H17 or Jan 2018) because Republicans know it has to happen this year \nor they are sitting ducks in 2018 and potentially unelectable for 6 years \n• Predicts no progress on tax reform over the next 6 weeks and then Republicans rally together to get behind a \nnew plan and get it done (enter Woo's VAT proposal) — with market messy in the meantime \n• Trump is obsessed with the stock market — when he sees it trade lower, he will act \n• Regarding valuation adjustment tax (VAT) vs. border adjustment tax, Woo favors a 5% VAT over BAT \no Why there is a <10% chance current proposal of BAT will get passed \n• Paul Ryan/Keven Brandy's proposal implies USD will appreciate +25%. Ryan is telling retailers this will happen \nbut this is completely unrealistic and has serious consequences. Why this cannot happen: \n• $20tn in non-USD assets owned by US households - $5tn hit on country's balance sheet \n• EM has —$4tn in USD-denominated debt — increase of $1tn in EM debt and hurts US investors ultimately \n• —30% corporate profits are overseas ($400bn — so $100bn hit to [PS) — even exporters get hit — \ncounterproductive \n• Commodity prices are in USD — hits purchasing power of rest of world in commodities — would see oil in the mid-\n$30s — hits Russia, Brazil, even Exxon \n• 60% of central bank reserves are in USD — this would go above 70% - would foreign CBs want to hold this much \nwhen the US economy is 25% of global GDP? Yields would need to increase \no BAT could get hung up with WTO (3-4 years.) Under BAT, wages are deductible (imported goods taxed as a share \nof total value but domestic goods taxed on only profits) — trade partners like Canada, Japan would take this to the WTO \nand we would wait 4 years for a verdict \no 5% VAT is WTO compliant and has several benefits \n• VAT levels playing field for US imported vs exported goods (no longer see BMW's cheaper in the US than \nGermany) \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014717 \n• VAT is revenue neutral — would raise enough revenue to cut corporate tax rate to 15%, even 10% possibly \n• While consumption taxes like VAT can hit the poor (Democrats hate them), there is room for carve-outs on \ngroceries, etc. There will be pushback from Republicans who hate lack of visibility of VAT as well. Only person who can \npass this is Trump. \n• Under BAT, the working class is arguably hit even worse than under VAT \no BAT would cause prices to go up at WMT and TGT (most of Trump's supporters shop there) \no Retailers would raise prices but exporters won't lower prices \no 5% VAT will result in a smaller average rise in prices (not entirely passed through), so less disruptive — would \nneed USD to strengthen only 3-4% \n• Where does this leave us? Only Trump can cut through the logjam. \n• Woo prefers Europe over US right now. European equities are climbing a wall of worry \n• Getting positive on energy \n• Buy the dip in May (-6 weeks). But own early-May or mid-May equity puts now. \n• Other anecdotes \no Regardless of your political preference, he thinks we all need Trump to succeed or the economy will get Bernie \nSanders or worse. \no Tillerson vs Kerry — Woo thinks Tillerson is actually working and getting things done, as opposed to Kerry who \njust cared about the Nobel. \n• Thus sees zero risk of a trade war with China \n• NAFTA is really more about China, not Mexico - and will ultimately benefit Mexico. Renegotiating NAFTA will \nremove the ability for Chinese exports to come in tariff-free through Mexico. \no Mnuchin and Cohn really know what they're doing and Woo thinks they will get there on VAT/ tax reform \n• Cases for tax reform \n1. US marginal tax rate = 35 % = highest among OECD = diminished returns to investment 4 solution = decrease \nmarginal tax rate \n2. US taxed on global income vs. territorial like other major economies. Issue because 1) US companies hold over \n$2t in capital overseas and 2) US companies acquiring smaller foreign companies to relocate headquarters \ninternationally 4 solution = shift to territorial tax system \n3. US = only OECD country w/ no VAT which puts US produced goods at disadvantage. (VAT — producer of exported \ngoods get rebate while importers pay) 4 solution = create VAT \n• Solutions have nothing to do with stimulus, will allow companies to take risk, invest, grow, and critical for global \ngrowth for next 10 yrs \nAnd from earlier presentations/calls: \n1. He mentioned on our March 1st tax reform call that the US is the only country amongst OECD without a VAT. \nBMW's thus cost less in the US than in Germany, as foreign companies get a VAT rebate when they export. US \ncompanies do not and they have to pay import tax. He views tax reform as very bullish for USD and yields (bearish for \nbond prices) and thinks the market is underpricing this. His rationale for the bullish USD and higher yields story is that \ntax reform encourages more money to come home to the US, adds US investment, evens the playing field for US \ncompanies — all good for US growth longer term and bullish the dollar. He had wanted tax reform by the August recess \nbut then Senate would need to pass the bill by July, so they would need a bill to work with by May for the House to pass \nit in May — which means they need a bill to work with by the end of March (running out of time!) BAT is the only really \ncontroversial aspect holding back tax reform even though it's a small part (2 paragraphs of the 50-page Ryan-Brady plan) \n— still vague on details but he hoped they're learning from their mistake of releasing a half-baked travel ban that \nimploded after a week. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014718 \n2. From a panel discussion last week: \n• Woo actually disagrees with some people's view that there is euphoria in the market. With real yields at -30bp, \nthe fixed income market is pricing in pessimism on Trump (and as I've mentioned, our colleagues in fixed income/FX and \ntheir clients have been quite a bit more bearish than those in equities.) \n• Believes there is fear of stagflation in the market, while gold going through the roof on worries of inflation. \n• However, if the US$ strengthens by 25%, it will be deflationary. Dangerous for EM countries loaded in US$ debt, \nesp in the wake of boarder adjustment tax reform talk. \n• Tax reform is the only thing that matters. \no US companies have $2-2.5trn of dormant cash sitting on their B/S outside of the US to avoid paying tax. \no US is the only OECD country without a VAT tax. \no What needs to happen is: implement a VAT tax that is border adjusted, and fix corporate tax rate. This will not \nonly boost US economy, but will give a jolt to the world economy as well. \no Positive that there is a solution, reform momentum on tax is strong regardless of political affiliation. There is a \nroad out of the quagmire. \no Question is: why when most other issues are getting leaked out of the White House, information on tax reform \nis not being leaked at all? Could it be a sign that the administration believes it is that important, and trying not to mess \nup on execution? [Or you could argue that there is nothing to leak at this point!] \no On timing of tax reform: It is crucial we get a blue print of tax reform in the next 2-3 weeks [now 1-2 weeks], \nbecause Congress would like to raise debt ceiling while discussing tax reform before summer recess. \no July 29th is start of summer recess, which means need to pass by May, requiring the bill proposal to be ready by \nMarch. Therefore, in the next few weeks, we need to see progress for an August deadline. \no On personal income tax, Trump and Obama are actually on the same page in terms of taxing the wealthy. \n• US banks have $100bn of excess capital in reserve: beyond what they need. Next big growth area for US banks is \ncommercial banking loans. Growth driver for US economy will be easy access to credit \n• Ryan-Brady Tax Blueprint released in 2016 - not many have actually read it, but many of the corporate clients \nseem better informed than hedge fund investors on this topic of late. \n• Rates: Just two weeks ago, the market was putting a less than 20% chance of a March 15th rate hike, vs now, it \nis priced in at an 86% chance. At this point, equities will sell off if no hike. \n• Fed will not hike in May ahead of French elections. \n3. David Woo's latest \"Cause and Effect\" is attached \n4. David Woo's Top Rates and FX Trades for 2017 is also attached. Woo believes that Brexit and the US election \nhave signaled that the world has changed. These ground shifts have been brought on by a backlash to globalization, \nincreasingly viewed as the culprit for wage stagnation, growing disparity of income and wealth between the rich and the \npoor, and the loss of national identity. For the year ahead, we recommend being bearish 5y US rates (seeing higher \nyields), long USDJPY (weaker JPY) and short a basket of EM LatAm long bonds (Mexico, Brazil and Colombia). But in the \nnear term, we urge caution with the reflation trade. Short by US real rates (seeing higher yields) offers the best risk-\nreward after recent moves. \nRegards, \nAmanda \nAmanda Ens \nDirector \nBank of America Merrill Lynch \nMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated \nOne Bryant Park, 5th Floor, New York, NY 10036 \nPhone: Mobile: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014719 \nRisk \nAwards \nWinner \nBank of America \nMerrill Lynch \nEquity derivatives \nhouse of the year \nThis message, and any attachments, is for the intended recipient(s) only, may contain information that is \nprivileged, confidential and/or proprietary and subject to important terms and conditions available at \nhttp://www.bankofamerica.com/emaildisclaimer.

A carbon tax would target the emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouses gases in the burning of \ngasoline, coal and other fossil fuels. \nThe study of the new options — which would represent major changes to American economic policy — comes as the \nadministration looks to tax reform as its next major battleground for implementing its agenda. Trump wants to cut \ntaxes sharply, but his advisers are looking for ways to raise revenue so as not to create a giant hole in the deficit. \nAdministration officials stressed that no final decision has been made and they are reviewing different alternatives. \nTwo officials and a third person confirmed the consideration of the value-added tax, while one official and the third \nperson confirmed the consideration of the carbon tax. \nThe search for new options reflects a recognition of the political challenges facing a proposal known as a border-\nadjustment tax that the White House and some Republicans had begun to rally around. The proposal, effectively a tax \non imports, would not only raise needed revenue but also serve to fulfill Trump's pledge to protect American \ncompanies from unfair export competition. \nThe tax would create incentives for companies to manufacture and produce goods domestically. But the proposal is \nunpopular with many other Republicans, who have said it would raise costs for consumers on things such as \nautomobiles, electronics and clothing. \nA value-added tax and a carbon tax have long been favored tools among economists, including some on the right, to \nraise revenue in a way that supports economic growth. But the prospect of any new taxes has long drawn skepticism \nfrom Republicans. \nAmanda Ens \nDirector \nBank of America Merrill Lynch \nMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated \nOne Bryant Park, 5th Floor, New York, NY 10036 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014858 \n<!--[if !vmI]--> \nBank of America \nMerrill Lynch \nAwards Equity denvatives \nhouse of the year \n<![endif]--> \nThis message, and any attachments, is for the intended recipient(s) only, may contain information that is privileged, confidential and/or \nproprietary and subject to important terms and conditions available at http://www.bankofamerica.com/emaildisclaimer.

The spread between the SX7E \nand S5BANKX Index is back to pre-US election levels. \nWhat the EU banks bulls are saying: \nEUR rates are going higher it's just a matter of timing, positive EPS revisions continue, EU is starting to \nsee pockets of volume growth and asset yield recovery, credit spreads have been tightening YTD and \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014861 \nattractive valuations of EU banks vs. US peers (EU banks on 12.0x 2017E PIE vs. US Banks on -14x and \nsome EU banks still on a large discount vs 10-year historical median P/B valuations). \nWhat the EU banks bears are saying: \nEU macro declining, US lead re-flation trade cooling (tax, deregulation, healthcare headwinds) and toppy \nmultiples/high ownership of EU banks going into Q1 results. They believe the pressure will be off Draghi to \nact on the deposit rate if the macro starts to reverse which may cause people to push back the assumed \ntiming of European rate hikes and tapering. The French election is also a big risk factor which is clearly \nholding back some global investors from buying into Europe. \nRates Update \nConsensus has started to factor in the higher rate outlook in Europe. The bears are pointing out that these \nprobabilities have fallen a lot this week while the bulls argue it's just a matter of timing. \nI monitor market expectations for ECB normalisation in rates using the World Interest Rate Probability \n(WIRP) function on Bloomberg. It's been very volatile recently. I currently see the market is pricing a \n16.6% probability of a EUR rate hike before the end of 2017 (row 6, column 2 below). a 32.7% probability \nin the next 12 months (row 9, column 2) and a 67.6% probability in the next 18 months. \nEi Ir.-. \n• Instrument \n3 Future Implied Probability \nCurrent Implied Probabilities \n1) Overview \nOIS: Eurozone OIS - Deposit F( \nDates o Meeting \tCalculation \nMeeting \tProb Of Hike \tProb of Cut \n04/27/2017 \t0.0% \t2A' \n06/08/2017 \t0.0% \t3.3% \n07/20/2017 \t2.1% \t3.2% \n09/07/2017 \t7.2% \t3.1% \n10/26/2017 \t8.8% \t3.0% \n12/14/2017 \t16.6% \t2.8% \n01/25/2018 \t21.6% \t2.6% \n03/08/2018 \t29.4% \t2.3% \n04/26/2018 \t32.7% \t2.2% \n06/14/2018 \t41.4% \t1.9% \n• Historical Analysis for Meeting \n:17/2017 \n) Add \nikal ted \n-0.6 \n0.0% \n0.0% \n0.0% \n0.0% \n0.0% \n0.0% \n0.0% \n0.0% \n0.0% \n• Current Rate -0.40 \n,•2 rates \nIn Based on rate -0.40 \n.)-1 '07/2017 \n-0.5 \n2.4% \n3.3% \n3 2% \n3.1% \n3.0% \n2.7% \n2.6% \n2.3% \n2.2% \n-0.4 \n97.6% \n96.7% \n94,6% \n89.7% \n88.2% \n80.6% \n75.8% \n68.2% \n65.1% \n•4) Add/Remove Series \n-0.3 \t-0.2 \tBPS• \n0.0% \t0.0% \t-0.2 \n0.0% \t0.0% \t-0.3 \n2.1% \t0,0% \t-0.1 \n7.1% \t0.1% \t0.4 \n8.6% \t0.2% \t0.6 \n15.6% \t1.0% \t1.5 \n19.6% \t1.9% \t2.1 \n25.4% \t3.7% \t3.1 \n27.5% \t4.8% \t36 \n32.5% \t7.8% \t5.0. \nAs a reminder our research team estimate that euro area banks could see as much as €26bn in earnings \nuplift from a return of ECB rates to zero. This would represent a 25% uplift to profits - a big prize when it \nhappens (click here for report). \nWhat to buy in banks if you share our view on sustained reflation? \nWe remain positive on banks that can make acceptable returns in the current environment and are geared \ninto the upside when rates begin to recover... ING, KBC, Intesa, Unicredit, SocGen, Erste, BKIR are \nall Buy rated. \nTop picks: \nBuy Soc Gen, PO C55 \n• Still fourth worst performer in the SX7E YTD due to French election overhang. \n• Yet reported a strong set of Q4 results, beating on P&L, capital and dividend which comforts our \nview that the stock is set for re-rating. \n• Continues to tick a number of boxes offering a dividend yield of 5.1% in 2017E, an attractive \nvaluation of 0.79x 2017e TNAV, solid capital position and has strong EPS momentum. \n• Our EPS (2017 and 2018) is 10% above consensus with further upside from CIB, Russia recovery \nand Corporate Center \n• Stronger capital position allows for growth (organic and bolt-on M&A) \nBuy Intesa, PO C2.80 \n• On NPEs, capital, profitability, operating trends, and cash payouts, Intesa stands above other \nItalian banks in our view. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 014862 \n• ISP will pay a dividend (confirmed) equivalent to an 8.0% yield vs. a 4.0% European banks \naverage and on our estimates \n• Italian banks are trading at a PNAV discount to ISP but their profitability is half that of ISP's and \ntheir capital is lower \n• ISP retains the lowest (gross/net) Italian NPE ratio and in 4Q16 NPE were down yoy by 8% \ngross/10% net. \n• Shares have suffered from the uncertainty related to a possible tie-up with insurer Generali - still \nthe seventh worst performing bank in the SX7E YTD \nAlso remain very bullish on market exposed Nordic banks \nThis morning we reiterate our preference for Nordic banks (click here for report) with more market \nexposed revenues and reiterate our Buy ratings on Danske Bank, Nordea, DNB and SEB ahead of Q1 \nresults. We expect to see good fee /trading income in Q1 on the back of strong AUM and continued high \nactivity levels. \nThe relative P/E premium of Nordic banks vs. the sector is now 7% vs. a long term average of 11%. We \nalso note that Nordic banks are expected to continue to deliver close to 4% better ROTE (2017-19E) and \nhave a lower beta. \nChart 1: Danske Bank remains best capital return story (Capital buffers as `)/0 of market cap) \n300 \n200 \n100 \n00 \n208 \n69 \n13.8 \n11.0 \nDANSKE SHBA \n10.8 \t10.8 \t10.4 \t10.3 \n5.8 \t6.4 \t6.1 \t6.0 \n4.9 \tZIEN \nSEBA \tNDA \tDNB \tSWEDA \nBuffer 17E Divi + Buyback (not yet executed) Buffer + Dii + Buyback (not executed) \nSource.

Regan; \nDenyse Sabagh; \nMichael Baxter; \nRobert Barnett; Weingarten, Reid; \nEllen Kerns; \nSubject: Re: The new iterations of Ghislaine Maxwell \nWe know of course that Saturdays are reserved for Matthew Horton. \nOn Saturday, July 1, 2017, 12:06:29 PM EDT, wrote: \nRich Beckler, \nKen Adams, \nDo you remember when I'd asked you what your daughters did for a living? Especially last night Mr. \nBeckler, as most Friday nights, no? \nYes, they are the new iterations of Ghislaine Maxwell; for you Richard Beckler, this originated from \nmy being a former Stone Ridge classmate of his elder daughter Katie Beckler, and because he was \non the Board of Stone Ridge during this period in time when my every family, friend, acquaintance \nand association was being contacted, bribed in one form or another, and turned against me (see \nbelow); as for Ken Adams, it stemmed from my having contacted him for representation in my 2011-\nfiled case against IBM also during this period of time when my every communication were being \ntracked. \nYou both are interesting; you let us see what's to become of the Scalia 35 (see below; at bottom, \nGhislaine Maxwell's Jeffrey Epstein in context.) \nWe start from this following precept: (the repeating 9/11s) \n1. \"Toward a New World Order\" speech by Pres. George H.W. Bush — 9/11 (1990) \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 015002 \n2. WTC Attack — 9/11 (2001) \n3. BENGHAZI Attack — 9/11 (2012) \nBut you have to remember that H. W. Bush was planted: \nAUTHOR PETER DALE SCOTT: Sometimes you have little deep events that most people don't even \nnotice. One of those would be the Halloween Massacre. The older people remember the Saturday \nNight Massacre which happened under Nixon. I'm talking about the Halloween Massacre of October \n31, 1975, and probably people watching this show have never heard of it. \nThat was under Ford, and Ford may have condoned it because it was trying to help restore his \npopularity. He was going way down in the polls. But it was a very important series of events all on the \nsame night. The head of the CIA was fired, William Colby, replaced by a relatively unknown man \ncalled George H. W. Bush who then went on to authorize something that Colby had refused to \nauthorize - the Team B report - the Team B to recalculate the Soviet threat and it was pre-\ndetermined. They were going to find that it was much bigger than the professionals angled like \nRaymond [inaudible] that I mentioned. \nThey said Russia is less of a threat now than it used to be. Well, that was terrible news for the \nindustrial complex so the Team B came in and said oh, no, no, no, it's much more of a threat than it \nused to be, and that's why we got this huge military build-up. It started actually under Carter but we \nthink of it as the Reagan build-up, and that of course is a major factor in having ended the Soviet \nUnion because the Soviet Union tried to match it with a weaker economy. And that arms race which \nwas not about threats but was about fighting economic war, that was an arms race which you could \nsay that the Soviet Union lost because they couldn't keep it up. Their economy went more and more \ndownhill because they were deflecting resources away from vital domestic functions. But really I'm \ntrying to talk here about the Halloween Massacre... \nJust the change in the CIA was a major historical event but it wasn't very visible. The second thing \nthat happened was they fired Jim Schlesinger as Secretary of Defense... It was being done by \n[President Ford's] Chief of Staff and his assistant who are two names barely known then but quite \nfamous since. Chief of staff was Donald Rumsfeld and the assistant was Dick Cheney. And that was \nthe first real intrusion of the Rumsfeld-Cheney team into American politics. And they became the real \nheart of what I consider the Deep State in the 1980s when they were planning for Continuity of \nGovernment which was a plan for emergency rules like warrantless surveillance and warrantless \ndetention and the militarization of homeland security. All those things were planned all through the \n'80s - COG planning by Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney. Even when Rumsfeld wasn't in the \ngovernment, he was authorized by Reagan to do this planning. \nAnd why is that important to our history? Because in 2001, these two men were now in the \ngovernment - Vice President and Secretary of Defense - the two top people in Washington on \nSeptember the 11th, 2001 when Bush was down in Florida - George W. Bush - and what did they do \non that day? They implemented the plans they had been planning for 20 years. Another major event \nin American history but it's not usually told that way. \nWe implemented - it's in the 9/11 Commission Report that COG plans were implemented on that day. \nThis is a huge change in our country. We now have an ARMY command, NORTHCOM, to take \ncharge of America - North America, the way SOUTHCOM is in charge of South America and \nCENTCOM is in charge of Central Asia. \nThis used to be illegal... We had the posse comitatus acts which said, yes, if there's a real emergency \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 015003 \nyou could call up the ARMY to deal with the emergency, but you cannot do it on a permanent basis \nbut we now do do it on a permanent basis. We haven't even bothered to repeal the posse comitatus. \nWe are in a state of emergency that was declared on September the 14th, 2001. And it's still \nenforced. It has to be renewed every year. Obama did it every year just as George Bush renewed it \nevery year. \nWhat are the roots of this? Well there are the legitimate roots that go back to fear of an atomic \ndecapitation of the government back in the Truman era, so legitimate COG planning goes back to \nTruman and Eisenhower, but the illegitimate use of COG to deal with any emergnecy you like, that \ngoes to the Reagan administration and it really goes back to the [Halloween] Massacre where \nRumsfeld and Cheney put their thumbprint on American politics for the first time. \n-- interview of Peter Dale Scott, @ min. 32:00, \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNqDAYWYFuQ&t=2433s \nThis all suggests that the start of the 9/11 agenda pre-dated him as well. I see now that there was a \nseemingly relevant 1990 event as well. \"On September 11, 1970 -- a date that only took on haunting \novertones with the attacks on New York and Washington in 2001 -- Nixon became the first U.S. \npresident to try to protect air travelers from extremists who sensed gaping vulnerabilities in security \nfor commercial airliners, issuing a statement listing a string of measures including the introduction of \n100 air marshals on U.S. planes. \"Most countries, including the United States, found effective means \nof dealing with piracy on the high seas a century and a half ago,\" Nixon said. \"We can -- and we will --\ndeal effectively with piracy in the skies today.\" \nThe President had been jolted into action by the simultaneous hijackings of planes in Europe headed \nto the United States. Jets belonging to TWA, Pan Am and Swissair were seized by the Popular Front \nfor the Liberation of Palestine. The group also attempted to hijack a jet over London belonging to the \nIsraeli airline El Al but was thwarted by security guards on board. \nThe Pan Am seizure ended quickly, but the passengers on the TWA and Swissair jets were diverted \nto a British air base in Jordan and the drama only ended after days of tense diplomacy, when the \nhostages were all released in a deal in which the Swiss, German, British and Israeli governments let \nPalestinian prisoners go.\" (http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/27/politics/terrorism-1970s-richard-\nnixon/index.html) \nThis 9/11 response sounds quite normal of course. But fast forward and the two secret service \nindividuals chosen for an April 2001 interview by a PWC staff member on behalf of what becomthe \nIBM Center for the Business of Government were (1) Steve Colo who happened to be the head of the \ndivision at SAIC that falsely labeled me a threat and added my name to some sort of Do Not Admit list \nat the end of a 5 month temp assignment in 2005 into early 2006. The consequence of the SAIC \ndesignation for me was the following: \n(I write) \"The SAIC designation took advantage of a devilish stratagem in which as a national security \nemployee (having filed out a SF-86 form, governed actually by the GSA - \nhttps://www.gsa.gov/portal/forms/download/116390 - for government clearance) working a designated \ncontract in a classified facility, being designated a disturbance/dissident/threat to operations, makes \none, in turn, a threat to national security - with all the surveillance/targeting that enables.\" In essence I \nwas made an enemy of the State and was tracked, my family and friends turned, my opportunities \nseized to include the opportunity to rear family as demonstrated especially in the 2007 sabotage of \nmy third trimester pregnancy and then the targeting and eventual capture of children I used to babysit \n- in 2011, they were predominantly tweens - to be used for sexual blackmail and other forms of \nleverage. The reason for the use of children in this barbaric way was to expend \"ops\" that were \nalready in effect and had been used to control many of the politicians that have been allowed to rise \nto the top (see info on the Franklin Scandal for example), and similarly according to the laws of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 015004 \ncompromise, the following which has been recently developing into highly coordinated murder \"ops\": \n(I write) \"The progress that was made from the absorbing of my (small) network (and this through \nsources and methods - money and other pleasureful compensations given to those willing to \nparticipate in and/or coordinate violence against me and my loved ones to include children leading \nonly to now their enabled targeting and the absorbing of whatever may be their networks - well, you \nsee below (and this only the very tip of the iceberg) how many people they've been able to engulf and \nwhat advances have been made by the quite elaborate criminal class employing these tactics; and \none also begins to better understand the events surrounding Justice Scalia's passing and what's to \ncome for the 35 guests in Scalia's private party. As for Scalia's passing, it was decidedly suspicious \nas noted by William Ritchie: (The Washington Post prints) \"As a former homicide commander, I am \nstunned that no autopsy was ordered for Justice Scalia,\" William 0. Ritchie, former head of criminal \ninvestigations for D.C. police, wrote in a post on Facebook on Sunday... Ritchie also raised questions \nabout the marshals' actions: \"How can the Marshal say, without a thorough post mortem, that he was \nnot injected with an illegal substance that would simulate a heart attack... Did the US Marshal check \nfor petechial hemorrhage in his eyes or under his lips that would have suggested suffocation? Did the \nUS Marshal smell his breath for any unusual odor that might suggest poisoning? My gut tells me \nthere is something fishy going on in Texas.\" \nAs for SAIC, the following also pertains: \n(I write) \"If you first see SAIC as what's called a systems integrator (author Tim Shorrock's phrase), \nand also the formerly married Bud and Sue Horton and their two grown sons Matthew Horton and \nBen Lanier as aids of an implementation, you can better see the bigger picture: \n(1) Sue Horton left IBM in early 2007-ish for an executive position at Tetra Tech which soon entered \ninto joint venture with SAIC (Sue's employer prior to IBM, btw) on an enormous (billion dollar) 2011 \nHillary Clinton State Department award (http://www.prnewswire.com/.../saic-tetra-tech-joint-venture-\na. .); \n(2) that Bud Horton left IBM in early 2009-ish for an executive position at Accenture which soon \nthereafter entered into joint venture with SAIC spin-off Leidos, and Cerner, on an enormous (billion \ndollar) 2015 DoD award (http://www.healthcareitnews.com/.../dod-names-ehr-contract-wi...); \n(3) that the Sue Horton contract was used to grow and fortify the Afghan heroin trade (as well as \ncorrupt law enforcement) although the stated intention was of course the opposite... (\"[SAIC and \nTetra Tech's] joint venture, Integrated Justice Systems International, LLC (USD, has been awarded a \ncontract to provide worldwide civilian police and criminal justice assistance to the U.S. Department of \nState's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL)... [specifically} to provide \nINL with program management, criminal justice, and life and mission support to countries emerging \nfrom conflict or otherwise facing instability challenges.

We look also to The American Deep State by Peter Dale Scott for evidence of ties between \nthe actions of the Clinton administration and (1) the 1993 attack on the WTC and (2) the 1998 attack \non the US embassy in Nairobi, Kenya which demonstrate that the Clinton administration in no \nuncertain terms sponsored terrorism: \n(Writes Scott) \"The homicidal crime suggested by Fenton's meticulous research is one both difficult \nand painful to contemplate. It has to be considered in the light of the earlier instances of protection we \nhave surveyed: \n1. the protection given to Salameh and Abouhalima in the 1990 Kahane murder, leaving them free to \nparticipate in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; \n2. the failure for two or three years to process Ali Mohamed's documents seized in 1990, which could \nhave prevented the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; \n3. the release of Ali Mohamed from Royal Canadian Mounted Police detention in 1993, leaving him \nfree to participate in the 1998 Nairobi Embassy bombing; \n4. the treatment of Ali Mohamed as an \"unindicted coconspirator\" in the 1993 WTC bombing case \nand Landmarks case, leaving him free to participate in the 1998 Nairobi Embassy bombing. \n(pp. 76-77, The American Deep State) \nScott had earlier examined these attacks in especial connection to the September 11, 2001 attack on \nthe WTC: \n(Writes Scott) \"For indeed it is certain that on various occasions U.S. agencies have intervened, \nletting al-Qaeda terrorists proceed with their plots. This alarming statement will be dismissed by some \nas \"conspiracy theory.\" Yet in this chapter, I will show that this claim doesn't to arise from theory, but \nfrom facts that are true, even though they have been systemically suppressed or under-reported in \nthe American mainstream media. I am describing a phenomenon that occurred not just once, but \nrepeatedly, almost predictably. We shall see that, among the al-Qaeda terrorists who were first \nprotected and then continued their activities were the following: \n1. Ali Mohamed, identified in the 9/11 Commission Report as the leader of the 1998 Nairobi Embassy \nbombing; \n2. Mohammed Jamal Khalife, Osama bin Laden's close friend and, while in the Philippines, financier \nof both Ramzi Yousef (principal architect of the first World Trade Center [WTC] attack) and his uncle \nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed; \n3. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, identified in the 9/11 Commission Report as \"the principal architect of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 015006 \nthe 9/11 attacks\"; \n4. Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, two of the alleged 9/11 hijackers, whose presence in the \nUnited States was concealed from the FBI by CIA officers for months before 9/11. \nIt might sound from these citations that the 9/11 Commission marked a new stage in the U.S. \ntreatment of these terrorists, and that the report now exposed those terrorists who in the past had \nbeen protected. On the contrary, a principal purpose of my chapter is to show that \n1. one purpose of protecting these individuals had been to protect a valued intelligence connection \n(the \"al-Qaeda connection,\" if you will); \n2. one major intention of the 9/11 Commission Report was to continue protecting this connection; \n3. those on the 9/11 Commission staff who were charged with this protection included at least one \ncommission member (Jamie Gorelick), one staff member (Dietrich Snell), and one important witness \n(Patrick Fitzgerald) who earlier had figured among the terrorists' protectors. \nIn the course of writing this chapter [Scott continues], I came to another disturbing conclusion I had \nnot anticipated. This is that a central feature of the protection has been to defend the 9/11 \nCommission's false picture of al-Qaeda as an example of non-state terrorism, ignoring not just the \nCIA but also the royal families of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. In reality, as I shall show, royal family \nprotection from Qatar and Saudi Arabia (concealed by the 9/11 Commission) was repeatedly given to \nkey figures like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged \"principal architect of the 9/11 attacks.\" The \nestablishment claims that the wars fought by America in Asia since 9/11 have been part of a global \n\"war on terror.\" But this \"war on terror\" has been fought in alliance with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and \nPakistan - precisely the principal political and financial backers of the al-Qaedist networks the United \nStates has supposedly been fighting. Meanwhile the most authentic opponents in the region of these \nSunni al-Qaedists - the governments of Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Iran - have found themselves \noverthrown (in the case of Iraq and Libya), subverted with U.S. support (in the case of Syria), or \nsanctioned and threatened as part of an \"axis of evil\" (in the case of Iran). We should not forget that, \njust one day after 9/11, \"Rumsfeld was talking about broadening the objectives of our response and \n'getting Iraq.\" \n(pp. 44-45, The American Deep State) \nClinton's daughter is now poised to work global health initiatives which I would suggest is little more \nthan a cover for on-going terrorism \"ops\". \nTo return to Steve Colo - in the interview he speaks of a partnership between the Secret Service, the \nFBI, and South Carolina's SLED (State Law Enforcement Division) to open a Computer Crime Center. \nBud Horton (mentioned above) (long-affiliated with IT Security; his title at Accenture was Chief \ntechnology officer of it's cyber security practice) happened to have just moved to South Carolina from \nLoudoun County after being implicated in a continuing child sex scandal (see details below). Further, \ncyber-crime just so happens to be another of the arenas in which our Intelligence Community \ncoordinates with the Russians: \"The US cooperates with the FSB and Russia's interior ministry on \ncounter-terrorism, organized crime, bio-terrorism, and cyber-crime.\" -- p. 243, Expelled: A Journalist's \nDescent into the Russian Mafia State, by Luke Harding) Most would interpret this quote to suggest \nthat the nations work together to prevent these various threats. The reality is more the opposite; trust \nme when I say that the US doesn't work \"ops\" alone - the 2005 London Bombings is one notable \nexample of a instance in which the US coordinated with also British intelligence in the perpetration of \nan attack.) I just tweeted this morning actually the following in regards to US coordinations with the \nRussians: \"One must know a renowned Rus mafiaso was granted entry \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyacheslay_lvankov#Moving_to_the_United_States ... be4 the real story \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 015007 \nof today's US-Rus relations is slowly known\" in response to the following comment @turndeaux: \nPeter Dale Scott, who writes about the Deep State, says Russia issue is \"a bona fide security issue, \nnot a diversion\". \nAbout Bud Horton and the Loudoun County matter - in attempts to make a long story short, the \nfollowing email chain: \nOn Monday, June 26, 2017 10:57 AM, \nSheriff Chapman, \nLoudoun Count, VA \nwrote: \nDid you ever consider that Loudoun was a target? That your community was induced to walk it's own \nchildren down the plank as compensation for what Loudoun had done to the young Dima Yakovlev? \nBecause now child exploitation is deeply embedded within your community with your own people \n(your own police, your own prosecutors, your own public defenders and private attorneys) protecting \nthis very system that will be used to take the futures of your Loudoun children (see more of the details \nbelow). Is it possible that that's how this happened, and you saw it not unfolding before your eyes?

Both of these latter individuals (Bud and Sue Horton) were \ninvolved in the 2007 murder of my son, and they in collusion with their son Matthew continue in the \nexploitation of children Anjulee and Xian Gunther. The powers that be intend now for these children to \n(continue to) follow in the footsteps of Ms. Simms, and to that end, I would advise that you become \nacquainted with (1) the ways in which Ms. Simms subsidized her law school education and off course \n(2) her current and related endeavors especially as they relate to drug trafficking and terror financing \n(see below email to Mr. Martin of the St. Augustine Record). \nOn Friday, June 23, 2017 8:36 AM, wrote: \nMr. Martin, \nSt. Augustine Record \nQuite an interesting article about the litigation between Deputy Banks and Rusty Rogers (see: \nDeputy Banks' attorney claims FDLE agent's credibility 'destroyed') It must also be explored, of \ncourse, that Officers Rodgers was once well respected for his investigation and exposure of a terrorist \nfinancing network that permeated the sunny state of Florida - (the NY Times reports) \"Agent Rodgers \njoined the state's elite investigative unit, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, where he \nquickly earned agent-of-the-year honors — and a meeting with the governor — for helping dismantle \na terrorist financing network that stretched from Florida to the Middle East\" - and that terrorism is very \nmuch a well-protected U.S. industry (see below). \nGod forbid some poor should get away with disrupting the delicate state of secreted operations; as \nyou yourself report, \"As written in [Plaintiff Banks] motion: \"Defendant Rodgers' false, misleading and \ninconsistent testimony throughout the discovery process is so pervasive and extreme, and involves \nso many material issues, it has destroyed Defendant's credibility on all issues...\" And here we see the \n\"whole-of-government\" attempts to restore balance. \nAs for the second Secret Service agent interviewed by the IBM Center for the Business of \nGovernment, his name is Dana Brown. He just so happened to have filled out his career with the \nFederal Air Marshall Service (October 2003-August 2008 as Director/Chief of Staff) followed by the \nTSA (March 2006-January 2009 as Asst. Administrator-Law Enforcement/Integrity Officer) states his \nLinked In profile. That he worked his way around to that which was largely put in place by the 1970 \n9/11 mini-event seems to me rather significant although I don't see all the details yet. I also don't yet \nsee exactly who it was that birthed this lengthy 9/11 initiative we're suffering. It seems clear, however, \nthat it was birthed prior to 1970. \nThe initiative has adjusted in some ways over time, but homage to 9/11 remains strong. Certain of the \npeople deeply involved in these manipulations thought it was kismet that an individual well-suited to \nhead the newly ordained Department of Homeland Security (that as we all know was the result of \nlegislation rushed through Congress in the aftermath of the 9/11 (2001) attack) was born on the \nmagical September 11th (this is Jeh Johnson); similarly, it is again being deemed a sign that the new \nDirector of the National Science Foundation (NSF) (chosen and positioned as she was) is first-named \nFrance (last name Cordova) and that this name so perfectly relates to US intentions to use the NSF \nto forward \"ops\" that will solidify a US-France working relationship in the same way the 2005 London \nBombings helped solidify the US-British working relationship. These France going-ons are in higher \ngear (I've noticed) since Macron was elected but it was prepped for long ago. I was working for IBM \nunder IBM project manager Cathie Skoog at the NSF when my third trimester pregnancy was \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 015009 \nsabotaged. The story of this sabotage and what followed is (briefly) this: \nI've long-alleged that John and Avery Gunther (whose children I used to babysit) agreed to a quid pro \nquo exchange of financial compensation for help destroying my credibility on behalf of IBM against \nwhom I'd filed a 2010 EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) charge and a subsequent \nMay 2011 civil suit. \nPer the May 11, 2011 Complaint, McGuire v. John and Avery Gunther: \n3. On April 6, 2011 Mr. and Mrs Gunther, with uncontrolled greed and total disregard for the rights \nand feelings of Ms. Nadine McGuire as well as those of their children, AFG and XWG, maliciously \nand with ill-intent, wrongfully completed and executed a Complaint and Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction requesting formal protection against Ms. Nadine McGuire. \n4. Over the course of the previous few months, Mr. and Mrs. Gunther, colluding with persons against \nwhom Ms. Nadine McGuire is currently furthering litigation, including but not limited to plaintiff's \nmother, Pauline Scala McGuire, and from whom they received and/or have been promised to receive \nmonetary incentives, hid their relationships with said individuals, further lied about having those \nrelationships in direct conversation with Ms. Nadine McGuire and Court testimony on May 4, 2011, \nand wrongfully completed and executed a Complaint and Motion for Preliminary Injunction against \nMs. Nadine McGuire in cooperation and collaboration with said persons, resulting in the issuance of a \nTemporary Restraining Order against Ms. Nadine McGuire issued on April 6, 2011. \n- Initial Complaint, 5/11/11, McGuire v. John and Avery Gunther, Case No.:2011 CA 003703 B, DC \nSuperior Court, Judge Gregory Jackson presiding \nIn regards to the suit against IBM (McGuire v. IBM, 1:11CV528, US District Court of Virginia), the only \nsuit in which Pauline Scala McGuire was listed as a defendant, the most important claim was one of \n\"assault\" that led to the 2007 death of my son. Per the filing: \nPlaintiff, Grace Nadine McGuire, realleges the allegations of paragraphs 1-65 hereof as if fully set \nforth within and further alleges: \n66. Defendant Palmisano's conduct in ascertaining the drug that was used on the plaintiff to end her \npregnancy and take the life of her child on April 22, 2007, constitutes an intentional touching of the \nplaintiff by defendant Palmisano, and was undertaken deliberately and with actual malice towards the \nplaintiff and her unborn child. \n67. Defendant Skoog, Susan Horton and Scala's conduct in coordinating the circumstances, creating \nphysical proximity and the administering of the drug to the plaintiff that ended her pregnancy and took \nthe life of her child on April 22, 2007 constituted an intentional touching of the plaintiff by said \ndefendants, and was undertaken deliberately and with actual malice towards the plaintiff and her \nunborn child. \n... 69. As the direct and proximate result of defendant Palmisano, Skoog, Susan Horton, and Scala's \nconduct, the plaintiff suffered a severe placental abruption, which terminated her pregnancy and \nended the life of her unborn child, causing the plaintiff to suffer damages including but not limited to \nthe loss of her child, loss of affection, grief, sorrow, extreme mental torment and emotional distress. \n- Initial Complaint, filed 5/16/11, McGuire v. IBM, et al, Case No.: 1:11CV528, US District Court of \nVirginia - Eastern Division, Alexandria, Judge Leonie Brinkema presiding \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 015010 \nThis is to say that John and Avery Gunther helped IBM defend against an allegation of murder, and in \nthis way they are accomplices to a cover-up. This is also to say that the characterization provided by \nJohn and Avery Gunther in their April 2011 Superior Court filing for a Protection Order against me \nand their admissions in this filing of having provided derogatory information to various persons and/or \nentities in the DC area to include school administrators, psychologists, and law enforcement, were \nmore to harm me, especially in my chances to hold IBM accountable, than to protect either \nthemselves or children Anjulee and Xian Gunther. \nI also long-allege that the relationship that developed from this initial quid pro quo led to John and \nAvery Gunther being similarly compensated for what turned into the sexual exploitation of their two \ndaughters. For more on child sexual exploitation for the sake of personal and professional leverage, \nsee especially the following: \nNick Bryant I The Franklin Scandal & The Elite's Pedophilia Cover Up, \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68gyGGPjmOo&t=978s \nThat the NSF won't acknowledge the abuse, and won't respond even to my FOIA requests, and \notherwise has gone to extents to protect Cathie Skoog and her co-conspirators at IBM and otherwise \nis all that was needed to have adequately turned the organization towards the interests of the Deep \nState. Now it is simply a matter of the Deep State continuing to put the NSF to use. \n* \n* \nJeffrey Epstein in context: \n(As sent to the Wash Post) \nI send you this in response to the recent column entitled Believe in the Process by Kenneth Starr. \nPerhaps rethink any public affiliation with Ken Starr; although his demeanor on paper is undoubtably \nconsoling, it is also a bit intoxifying when it would be best now if we keep our wits about us, no? \nI say this from the following perspective - Ken Starr of the Starr Report, attorney for (1) Erik Prince of \nBlackwater and (2) convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein in context: \nThe Starr Report buried behind salacious detail of the Lewinsky affair almost nothing of Whitewater, \nTravelgate, or otherwise what many consider the murder of Vince Foster (Foster, albeit the subject of \na different investigation was also under the purview of attorney Starr and formal investigation of the \nresults of Starr's investigation were drowned out by the details of the Lewinsky affair.) This is a bit \nstrange considering the Lewinsky affair was a moral failing and not an actionable criminal one as \nwould have been the others had any proof surfaced. \nStarr later defended Blackwater against wrongful deaths suit initiated by the families of the 2004 \nFallujah Ambush victims - \"In October 2006, Blackwater hired one of the nation's heaviest-hitting \nlawyers to represent it - Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel in the 1999 impeachment of \nPresident Bill Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal... Starr and his colleagues argued that \nBlackwater was \"constitutionally immune\" from such lawsuits and said that if the Fallujah case were \nallowed to proceed, \"Blackwater will suffer irreparable harm.\" In the eighteen-page petition to the \nSupreme Court, Blackwater argued that there are no other such lawsuits against private \nmilitary/security companies in state courts \"because the comprehensive regulatory scheme enacted \nby Congress and the President grant military contractors like Blackwater immunity from state-court \nlitigation.\" (pp. 234-235, Blackwater). (Author Ken Davis writes) \"The four men had spent the night \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 015011 \nbefore they set off at marine base Camp Fallujah. But the men kept their distance from the \nleathernecks. Had they spoken to the marines, the Blackwater team might have learned that the \nAmericans were already in the midst of a major offensive meant to assert control over the \nincreasingly restive city, where elements of the radical Islamist movement and remnants of Saddam's \narmy were beginning to aggressively strike back. at the American occupation\" (p. 306, The Hidden \nHistory of American at War), and perhaps this is the only thing that makes sense of the fact that \n\"Under the terms of its contract, Blackwater was supposed to supply these convoy security missions \nwith two SUVs, each carrying three guards per vehicle; a driver, one man riding shotgun, and a third \nman in back with a heavy machine gun. Instead, the foursome set out that morning with just two men \nper car, each vehicle missing their rear gunner. The SUVs were only outfitted with a steel plate as \nextra armor. And the men had not been given maps.\" (p. 305). \nStarr went on to defend Jeffrey Epstein abasing allegations of child sex trafficking - \"Along with a \ndream team of attorneys that included Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, and Ken Starr, [Alan Dershowitz] \nwas successful in getting federal investigators not to charge Epstein with moving his victims across \nstate lines and other associated crimes. The federal non-prosecution agreement Epstein's legal team \nnegotiated with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida immunized all named and \nunnamed \"potential co-conspirators\" in Epstein's child trafficking network, which includes those who \nallegedly procured minors for Epstein and also any powerbrokers who may have molested them\" (-\nhttp://gawker.com/flight-logs-put-clinton-dershowitz-on-ped...). Otherwise, Epstein's eventual 18 \nmonth sentence by the state of Florida was exceptionally light under the circumstances to include the \nnumber of victims who came forward with testimony. This is best understood in the context of children \nbeing used as a means to government-sponsored sexual blackmail and other forms of leverage. \nSee here Erik Prince in greater context: (the similarities between him and once (secretly) favored \nchild Bin Laden) \nThe coordinations among global intelligence to make rather than eliminate terror as seen thru \n\"assets\" bin Laden (as M. Noriega before him) & Erik Prince: \nAbout BL: \"Some CIA officers will later say that [BL] serves as a semi-official liaison between the GIP \n[Saudi intell and warlords like Sayyaf.\" \n(www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=ahmed_badeeb_1) \nAbout EP: \"Handcuffed by politics, the CIA had not been able to cultivate relationships with the key \nbut messy leaders. Fortunately, Blackwater had no such political restrictions.\" (p. 54, Civilian Warriors \nby E. Prince) \nWe see also: \nAbout BL: \"Bin Laden established camps inside Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan and trained \nvolunteers from across the Muslim world to fight against the Soviet-backed regime, the Democratic \nRepublic of Afghanistan\" (Wikipedia) \nAbout EP: \"In his autobiography, he states that during the Yugoslav Wars in the early 1990s, he \nrealized the need for private training facilities for special operations... Prince moved to Virginia Beach \nand personally financed the formation of Blackwater Worldwide in 1997. He bought 6,000 acres (24 \nkm2) of the Great Dismal Swamp of North Carolina and set up a school for special operations\" \n(Wikipedia) \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 015012 \nErik Prince is (becoming) no less an Amer. intelligence success story than bin Laden (in support of \nTerrorism as Geostrategy & a New World Order - see below). In short: (we note the repeating 9/11s, \nevery 11 years): \"Toward a NWO\" speech by Bush #41 - Sept. 11 ('90); The WTC - Sept. 11 ('01); \nBenghazi - Sept. 11 ('12). (There is rhy. & reason also 2 the rise of ISIS.) \n*** \nAbout training camps: \nI watched so to speak the creating of little torture pockets around the world as justified by Obama's \ndesire to close Gitmo. The White House reports (2/23/16): \"We'll continue to securely and responsibly \ntransfer to other countries the 35 detainees already approved for transfer. This process involves \nextensive and careful coordination across our federal government to ensure that our national security \ninterests are met when an individual is transferred to another country. We insist, for example, that \nforeign countries institute strong security measures.\" But are these not just the seeds of new training \ncamps (growing concentrated and lauded violent temperaments) & was that not someone's exact \nintent? \nIn real-time (and as perpetrated on captured children): \n3/19/14, sent to the now defunct FB page of D. Cheney: \nDick Cheney, \nI wonder if it's possible that there is coordination with other countries concerning enhanced \ninterrogation techniques, in the form of training perhaps? \nSpecifically, here in the United States, my sense is that there may be the use of vulnerable \npopulations, with the intension to gain favor with and/or intimidate others, especially members of the \ninternational community. \nAnd: \nOn Saturday, June 21, 2014 6:37 AM, \nTo: \nDeputy Lyddy, \nwrote: \nHer energy is very weak. She is physically exhausted, VERY sleep deprived, and HUNGRY. \n[These were continuing experimentations in reversed-engineered SERE; the agreed upon \ntechniques, taken from various regions of the world to be distributed to the various regions of the \nworld, had to be deemed not torture and this is where organizations like the APA stepped in, then \n(during the Bush administration), and afterwards. See here for example: \"And I think, you know, \nwhat's really important in the debate going forward among psychologists is the extent to which \npsychologists loaned their names and loaned their credentials and their Ph.D.s to this kind of activity \nand essentially were used by the Bush administration to provide a kind of \"get out of jail free\" card for \nthe people who were, you know, doing these interrogations, because the logic, which I think Mark had \nmentioned, is, you know, this circular logic. So long as there are trained psychologists from \nthe SERE program who are on site at these interrogations who are saying that these detainees can \nwithstand this treatment, are not being harmed psychologically, then it's not torture. So, you know, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 015013 \nyou've got this sort of [inaudible] tortured — tortured logic, which is the phrase that has come up, but \nit's this sort of self-justifying loop in which professionals are loaning their credentials to this kind of \nactivity. And you see the same thing in the Office of Legal Counsel, where you have, you know, \nlawyers loaning their credentials to approving what are clear violations of the Geneva Conventions.\" \n(https://www.democracynow.ord/2009/4/21/the story of mitchell lessen associates)] \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 015014 \n",

Especially last night Mr. \nBeckler, as most Friday nights, no? \nYes, they are the new iterations of Ghislaine Maxwell; for you Richard Beckler, this originated from \nmy being a former Stone Ridge classmate of his elder daughter Katie Beckler, and because he was \non the Board of Stone Ridge during this period in time when my every family, friend, acquaintance \nand association was being contacted, bribed in one form or another, and turned against me (see \nbelow); as for Ken Adams, it stemmed from my having contacted him for representation in my 2011-\nfiled case against IBM also during this period of time when my every communication were being \ntracked. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 015015 \nYou both are interesting; you let us see what's to become of the Scalia 35 (see below; at bottom, \nGhislaine Maxwell's Jeffrey Epstein in context.) \nWe start from this following precept: (the repeating 9/11s) \n1. \"Toward a New World Order\" speech by Pres. George H.W. Bush — 9/11 (1990) \n2. WTC Attack — 9/11 (2001) \n3. BENGHAZI Attack — 9/11 (2012) \nBut you have to remember that H. W. Bush was planted: \nAUTHOR PETER DALE SCOTT: Sometimes you have little deep events that most people don't even \nnotice. One of those would be the Halloween Massacre. The older people remember the Saturday \nNight Massacre which happened under Nixon. I'm talking about the Halloween Massacre of October \n31, 1975, and probably people watching this show have never heard of it. \nThat was under Ford, and Ford may have condoned it because it was trying to help restore his \npopularity. He was going way down in the polls. But it was a very important series of events all on \nthe same night. The head of the CIA was fired, William Colby, replaced by a relatively unknown man \ncalled George H. W. Bush who then went on to authorize something that Colby had refused to \nauthorize - the Team B report - the Team B to recalculate the Soviet threat and it was pre-\ndetermined. They were going to find that it was much bigger than the professionals angled like \nRaymond [inaudible] that I mentioned. \nThey said Russia is less of a threat now than it used to be. Well, that was terrible news for the \nindustrial complex so the Team B came in and said oh, no, no, no, it's much more of a threat than it \nused to be, and that's why we got this huge military build-up. It started actually under Carter but we \nthink of it as the Reagan build-up, and that of course is a major factor in having ended the Soviet \nUnion because the Soviet Union tried to match it with a weaker economy. And that arms race which \nwas not about threats but was about fighting economic war, that was an arms race which you could \nsay that the Soviet Union lost because they couldn't keep it up. Their economy went more and more \ndownhill because they were deflecting resources away from vital domestic functions. But really I'm \ntrying to talk here about the Halloween Massacre... \nJust the change in the CIA was a major historical event but it wasn't very visible. The second thing \nthat happened was they fired Jim Schlesinger as Secretary of Defense... It was being done by \n[President Ford's] Chief of Staff and his assistant who are two names barely known then but quite \nfamous since. Chief of staff was Donald Rumsfeld and the assistant was Dick Cheney. And that was \nthe first real intrusion of the Rumsfeld-Cheney team into American politics. And they became the real \nheart of what I consider the Deep State in the 1980s when they were planning for Continuity of \nGovernment which was a plan for emergency rules like warrantless surveillance and warrantless \ndetention and the militarization of homeland security. All those things were planned all through the \n'80s - COG planning by Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney. Even when Rumsfeld wasn't in the \ngovernment, he was authorized by Reagan to do this planning. \nAnd why is that important to our history? Because in 2001, these two men were now in the \ngovernment - Vice President and Secretary of Defense - the two top people in Washington on \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 015016 \nSeptember the 11th, 2001 when Bush was down in Florida - George W. Bush - and what did they do \non that day? They implemented the plans they had been planning for 20 years. Another major event \nin American history but it's not usually told that way. \nWe implemented - it's in the 9/11 Commission Report that COG plans were implemented on that \nday. This is a huge change in our country. We now have an ARMY command, NORTHCOM, to take \ncharge of America - North America, the way SOUTHCOM is in charge of South America and \nCENTCOM is in charge of Central Asia. \nThis used to be illegal... We had the posse comitatus acts which said, yes, if there's a real \nemergency you could call up the ARMY to deal with the emergency, but you cannot do it on a \npermanent basis but we now do do it on a permanent basis. We haven't even bothered to repeal the \nposse comitatus. We are in a state of emergency that was declared on September the 14th, 2001. \nAnd it's still enforced. It has to be renewed every year. Obama did it every year just as George Bush \nrenewed it every year. \nWhat are the roots of this? Well there are the legitimate roots that go back to fear of an atomic \ndecapitation of the government back in the Truman era, so legitimate COG planning goes back to \nTruman and Eisenhower, but the illegitimate use of COG to deal with any emergnecy you like, that \ngoes to the Reagan administration and it really goes back to the [Halloween] Massacre where \nRumsfeld and Cheney put their thumbprint on American politics for the first time. \n-- interview of Peter Dale Scott, @ min. 32:00, \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNqDAYWYFuQ&t=2433s \nThis all suggests that the start of the 9/11 agenda pre-dated him as well. I see now that there was a \nseemingly relevant 1990 event as well. \"On September 11, 1970 -- a date that only took on haunting \novertones with the attacks on New York and Washington in 2001 -- Nixon became the first U.S. \npresident to try to protect air travelers from extremists who sensed gaping vulnerabilities in security \nfor commercial airliners, issuing a statement listing a string of measures including the introduction of \n100 air marshals on U.S. planes. \"Most countries, including the United States, found effective means \nof dealing with piracy on the high seas a century and a half ago,\" Nixon said. \"We can -- and we will - \n- deal effectively with piracy in the skies today.\" \nThe President had been jolted into action by the simultaneous hijackings of planes in Europe headed \nto the United States. Jets belonging to TWA, Pan Am and Swissair were seized by the Popular Front \nfor the Liberation of Palestine. The group also attempted to hijack a jet over London belonging to the \nIsraeli airline El Al but was thwarted by security guards on board. \nThe Pan Am seizure ended quickly, but the passengers on the TWA and Swissair jets were diverted \nto a British air base in Jordan and the drama only ended after days of tense diplomacy, when the \nhostages were all released in a deal in which the Swiss, German, British and Israeli governments let \nPalestinian prisoners go.\" (http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/27/politics/terrorism-1970s-richard-\nnixon/index.html) \nThis 9/11 response sounds quite normal of course. But fast forward and the two secret service \nindividuals chosen for an April 2001 interview by a PWC staff member on behalf of what becomthe \nIBM Center for the Business of Government were (1) Steve Colo who happened to be the head of \nthe division at SAIC that falsely labeled me a threat and added my name to some sort of Do Not \nAdmit list at the end of a 5 month temp assignment in 2005 into early 2006. The consequence of the \nSAIC designation for me was the following: \n(I write) \"The SAIC designation took advantage of a devilish stratagem in which as a national \nsecurity employee (having filed out a SF-86 form, governed actually by the GSA - \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 015017 \nhttps://www.osa.clov/portal/forms/download/116390 - for government clearance) working a \ndesignated contract in a classified facility, being designated a disturbance/dissident/threat to \noperations, makes one, in turn, a threat to national security - with all the surveillance/targeting that \nenables.\" In essence I was made an enemy of the State and was tracked, my family and friends \nturned, my opportunities seized to include the opportunity to rear family as demonstrated especially \nin the 2007 sabotage of my third trimester pregnancy and then the targeting and eventual capture of \nchildren I used to babysit - in 2011, they were predominantly tweens - to be used for sexual \nblackmail and other forms of leverage. The reason for the use of children in this barbaric way was to \nexpend \"ops\" that were already in effect and had been used to control many of the politicians that \nhave been allowed to rise to the top (see info on the Franklin Scandal for example), and similarly \naccording to the laws of compromise, the following which has been recently developing into highly \ncoordinated murder \"ops\": \n(I write) \"The progress that was made from the absorbing of my (small) network (and this through \nsources and methods - money and other pleasureful compensations given to those willing to \nparticipate in and/or coordinate violence against me and my loved ones to include children leading \nonly to now their enabled targeting and the absorbing of whatever may be their networks - well, you \nsee below (and this only the very tip of the iceberg) how many people they've been able to engulf \nand what advances have been made by the quite elaborate criminal class employing these tactics; \nand one also begins to better understand the events surrounding Justice Scalia's passing and what's \nto come for the 35 guests in Scalia's private party. As for Scalia's passing, it was decidedly \nsuspicious as noted by William Ritchie: (The Washington Post prints) \"As a former homicide \ncommander, I am stunned that no autopsy was ordered for Justice Scalia,\" William 0. Ritchie, former \nhead of criminal investigations for D.C. police, wrote in a post on Facebook on Sunday... Ritchie also \nraised questions about the marshals' actions: \"How can the Marshal say, without a thorough post \nmortem, that he was not injected with an illegal substance that would simulate a heart attack... Did \nthe US Marshal check for petechial hemorrhage in his eyes or under his lips that would have \nsuggested suffocation? Did the US Marshal smell his breath for any unusual odor that might suggest \npoisoning? My gut tells me there is something fishy going on in Texas.\" \nAs for SAIC, the following also pertains: \n(I write) \"If you first see SAIC as what's called a systems integrator (author Tim Shorrock's phrase), \nand also the formerly married Bud and Sue Horton and their two grown sons Matthew Horton and \nBen Lanier as aids of an implementation, you can better see the bigger picture: \n(1) Sue Horton left IBM in early 2007-ish for an executive position at Tetra Tech which soon entered \ninto joint venture with SAIC (Sue's employer prior to IBM, btw) on an enormous (billion dollar) 2011 \nHillary Clinton State Department award (http://www.prnewswire.com/.../saic-tetra-tech-joint-venture-\na...); \n(2) that Bud Horton left IBM in early 2009-ish for an executive position at Accenture which soon \nthereafter entered into joint venture with SAIC spin-off Leidos, and Cerner, on an enormous (billion \ndollar) 2015 DoD award (http://www.healthcareitnews.com/.../dod-names-ehr-contract-wi...); \n(3) that the Sue Horton contract was used to grow and fortify the Afghan heroin trade (as well as \ncorrupt law enforcement) although the stated intention was of course the opposite... (\"[SAIC and \nTetra Tech's] joint venture, Integrated Justice Systems International, LLC (USD, has been awarded a \ncontract to provide worldwide civilian police and criminal justice assistance to the U.S. Department of \nState's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL)... [specifically} to \nprovide INL with program management, criminal justice, and life and mission support to countries \nemerging from conflict or otherwise facing instability challenges. Under this new contract, IJSI will \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 015018 \nprovide technical assistance, training, logistics and infrastructure services to support the Department \nof State's efforts to strengthen criminal justice systems in select partner countries.\").., yet, just \nmonths shy of contract end, the NY Times reported: \"Tasked With Combating Opium, Afghan \nOfficials Profit From It;\" \"Penetrating Every Stage of Afghan Opium Chain, Taliban become a Cartel;\" \nand \"Corrupt Combatants Fight for Control of Lucrative Afghan Drug Trade;\" see also here an \noverview of the growth of Afghan opium production from the start of the US occupation (2001) to the \npresent, and especially from contract start (2011) to end (2016): http://www.olobalresearch.ca/the-\nspoils-of-war-afghanist.../91; \n(4) and that the award Bud Horton helped secure just as Sue's contract was coming to an end was \nnot only born from what looks like Franklin Scandal compromises, but it is this contract that seems \nintent on implementing bioterrorism as the new form of explosive terrorism.\" \n(Note that both members of this family were awarded BILLION dollar contracts; that's quite \nexceptional, no?) \nAs for terrorism as an US industry, it's hardly better seen than through the following which is \ninformation of course we all know: \nWe note that in-between Bush #41's 9/11/1990 speech(with Dick Cheney as his Secretary of \nDefense) and the 9/11/2001 attack on the WTC were little more than Clinton's 8 years in the White \nHouse. We look also to The American Deep State by Peter Dale Scott for evidence of ties between \nthe actions of the Clinton administration and (1) the 1993 attack on the WTC and (2) the 1998 attack \non the US embassy in Nairobi, Kenya which demonstrate that the Clinton administration in no \nuncertain terms sponsored terrorism: \n(Writes Scott) \"The homicidal crime suggested by Fenton's meticulous research is one both difficult \nand painful to contemplate. It has to be considered in the light of the earlier instances of protection \nwe have surveyed: \n1. the protection given to Salameh and Abouhalima in the 1990 Kahane murder, leaving them free to \nparticipate in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; \n2. the failure for two or three years to process Ali Mohamed's documents seized in 1990, which could \nhave prevented the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; \n3. the release of Ali Mohamed from Royal Canadian Mounted Police detention in 1993, leaving him \nfree to participate in the 1998 Nairobi Embassy bombing; \n4. the treatment of Ali Mohamed as an \"unindicted coconspirator\" in the 1993 WTC bombing case \nand Landmarks case, leaving him free to participate in the 1998 Nairobi Embassy bombing. \n(pp. 76-77, The American Deep State) \nScott had earlier examined these attacks in especial connection to the September 11, 2001 attack \non the WTC: \n(Writes Scott) \"For indeed it is certain that on various occasions U.S. agencies have intervened, \nletting al-Qaeda terrorists proceed with their plots. This alarming statement will be dismissed by \nsome as \"conspiracy theory.\" Yet in this chapter, I will show that this claim doesn't to arise from \ntheory, but from facts that are true, even though they have been systemically suppressed or under-\nreported in the American mainstream media. I am describing a phenomenon that occurred not just \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 015019 \nonce, but repeatedly, almost predictably. We shall see that, among the al-Qaeda terrorists who were \nfirst protected and then continued their activities were the following: \n1. Ali Mohamed, identified in the 9/11 Commission Report as the leader of the 1998 Nairobi \nEmbassy bombing; \n2. Mohammed Jamal Khalife, Osama bin Laden's close friend and, while in the Philippines, financier \nof both Ramzi Yousef (principal architect of the first World Trade Center [WTC] attack) and his uncle \nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed; \n3. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, identified in the 9/11 Commission Report as \"the principal architect of \nthe 9/11 attacks\"; \n4. Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, two of the alleged 9/11 hijackers, whose presence in the \nUnited States was concealed from the FBI by CIA officers for months before 9/11. \nIt might sound from these citations that the 9/11 Commission marked a new stage in the U.S. \ntreatment of these terrorists, and that the report now exposed those terrorists who in the past had \nbeen protected. On the contrary, a principal purpose of my chapter is to show that \n1. one purpose of protecting these individuals had been to protect a valued intelligence connection \n(the \"al-Qaeda connection,\" if you will); \n2. one major intention of the 9/11 Commission Report was to continue protecting this connection; \n3. those on the 9/11 Commission staff who were charged with this protection included at least one \ncommission member (Jamie Gorelick), one staff member (Dietrich Snell), and one important witness \n(Patrick Fitzgerald) who earlier had figured among the terrorists' protectors. \nIn the course of writing this chapter [Scott continues], I came to another disturbing conclusion I had \nnot anticipated. This is that a central feature of the protection has been to defend the 9/11 \nCommission's false picture of al-Qaeda as an example of non-state terrorism, ignoring not just the \nCIA but also the royal families of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. In reality, as I shall show, royal family \nprotection from Qatar and Saudi Arabia (concealed by the 9/11 Commission) was repeatedly given \nto key figures like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged \"principal architect of the 9/11 attacks.\" The \nestablishment claims that the wars fought by America in Asia since 9/11 have been part of a global \n\"war on terror.\" But this \"war on terror\" has been fought in alliance with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and \nPakistan - precisely the principal political and financial backers of the al-Qaedist networks the United \nStates has supposedly been fighting. Meanwhile the most authentic opponents in the region of these \nSunni al-Qaedists - the governments of Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Iran - have found themselves \noverthrown (in the case of Iraq and Libya), subverted with U.S. support (in the case of Syria), or \nsanctioned and threatened as part of an \"axis of evil\" (in the case of Iran). We should not forget that, \njust one day after 9/11, \"Rumsfeld was talking about broadening the objectives of our response and \n'getting Iraq.\" \n(pp. 44-45, The American Deep State) \nClinton's daughter is now poised to work global health initiatives which I would suggest is little more \nthan a cover for on-going terrorism \"ops\". \nTo return to Steve Colo - in the interview he speaks of a partnership between the Secret Service, the \nFBI, and South Carolina's SLED (State Law Enforcement Division) to open a Computer Crime \nCenter. Bud Horton (mentioned above) (long-affiliated with IT Security; his title at Accenture was \nChief technology officer of it's cyber security practice) happened to have just moved to South \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 015020 \nCarolina from Loudoun County after being implicated in a continuing child sex scandal (see details \nbelow). Further, cyber-crime just so happens to be another of the arenas in which our Intelligence \nCommunity coordinates with the Russians: \"The US cooperates with the FSB and Russia's interior \nministry on counter-terrorism, organized crime, bio-terrorism, and cyber-crime.\" -- p. 243, Expelled: A \nJournalist's Descent into the Russian Mafia State, by Luke Harding) Most would interpret this quote \nto suggest that the nations work together to prevent these various threats. The reality is more the \nopposite; trust me when I say that the US doesn't work \"ops\" alone - the 2005 London Bombings is \none notable example of a instance in which the US coordinated with also British intelligence in the \nperpetration of an attack.) I just tweeted this morning actually the following in regards to US \ncoordinations with the Russians: \"One must know a renowned Rus mafiaso was granted entry \nhttps://en.wikipedia.orcilwiki/Vyacheslay Ivankov#Movinq to the United States ... be4 the real \nstory of today's US-Rus relations is slowly known\" in response to the following comment \n@turndeaux: Peter Dale Scott, who writes about the Deep State, says Russia issue is \"a bona fide \nsecurity issue, not a diversion\". \nAbout Bud Horton and the Loudoun County matter - in attempts to make a long story short, the \nfollowing email chain: \nOn Monday, June 26, 2017 10:57 AM, wrote: \nSheriff Chapman, \nLoudoun Count, VA \nDid you ever consider that Loudoun was a target?

Halliburton is a story all by itself.\" \n(says Stan Goff, http://narconews.com/qoffmccormick1.html)) \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 015021 \nOn Saturday, June 24, 2017 2:43 PM, wrote: \nMr. Satz, \nState's Attorney, Broward County, Fl \nI'm forwarding the below information as it pertains to Mrs. Lesley Simms and more importantly the \nones with whom she continues to coordinate. \nAs you may know, she was once close with an individual named Matthew Horton with whom she \nattended George Mason University, and through Matthew, Ms. Simms became well-acquainted with \nMatthew's parents Henry \"Bud\" Horton and Sue Popovich Horton who helped secure her a position \nat IBM upon her graduation from GMU. Both of these latter individuals (Bud and Sue Horton) were \ninvolved in the 2007 murder of my son, and they in collusion with their son Matthew continue in the \nexploitation of children Anjulee and Xian Gunther. The powers that be intend now for these children \nto (continue to) follow in the footsteps of Ms. Simms, and to that end, I would advise that you \nbecome acquainted with (1) the ways in which Ms. Simms subsidized her law school education and \noff course (2) her current and related endeavors especially as they relate to drug trafficking and \nterror financing (see below email to Mr. Martin of the St. Augustine Record). \nOn Friday, June 23, 2017 8:36 AM, \nMr. Martin, \nSt. Augustine Record \nwrote: \nQuite an interesting article about the litigation between Deputy Banks and Rusty Rogers (see: \nDeputy Banks' attorney claims FDLE agent's credibility 'destroyed') It must also be explored, of \ncourse, that Officers Rodgers was once well respected for his investigation and exposure of a \nterrorist financing network that permeated the sunny state of Florida - (the NY Times reports) \"Agent \nRodgers joined the state's elite investigative unit, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, where \nhe quickly earned agent-of-the-year honors — and a meeting with the governor — for helping \ndismantle a terrorist financing network that stretched from Florida to the Middle East\" - and that \nterrorism is very much a well-protected U.S. industry (see below). \nGod forbid some poor should get away with disrupting the delicate state of secreted operations; as \nyou yourself report, \"As written in [Plaintiff Banks] motion: \"Defendant Rodgers' false, misleading \nand inconsistent testimony throughout the discovery process is so pervasive and extreme, and \ninvolves so many material issues, it has destroyed Defendant's credibility on all issues...\" And here \nwe see the \"whole-of-government\" attempts to restore balance. \nAs for the second Secret Service agent interviewed by the IBM Center for the Business of \nGovernment, his name is Dana Brown. He just so happened to have filled out his career with the \nFederal Air Marshall Service (October 2003-August 2008 as Director/Chief of Staff) followed by the \nTSA (March 2006-January 2009 as Asst. Administrator-Law Enforcement/Integrity Officer) states his \nLinked In profile. That he worked his way around to that which was largely put in place by the 1970 \n9/11 mini-event seems to me rather significant although I don't see all the details yet. I also don't yet \nsee exactly who it was that birthed this lengthy 9/11 initiative we're suffering. It seems clear, \nhowever, that it was birthed prior to 1970. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 015022 \nThe initiative has adjusted in some ways over time, but homage to 9/11 remains strong. Certain of \nthe people deeply involved in these manipulations thought it was kismet that an individual well-suited \nto head the newly ordained Department of Homeland Security (that as we all know was the result of \nlegislation rushed through Congress in the aftermath of the 9/11 (2001) attack) was born on the \nmagical September 11th (this is Jeh Johnson); similarly, it is again being deemed a sign that the new \nDirector of the National Science Foundation (NSF) (chosen and positioned as she was) is first-\nnamed France (last name Cordova) and that this name so perfectly relates to US intentions to use \nthe NSF to forward \"ops\" that will solidify a US-France working relationship in the same way the \n2005 London Bombings helped solidify the US-British working relationship. These France going-ons \nare in higher gear (I've noticed) since Macron was elected but it was prepped for long ago. I was \nworking for IBM under IBM project manager Cathie Skoog at the NSF when my third trimester \npregnancy was sabotaged. The story of this sabotage and what followed is (briefly) this: \nI've long-alleged that John and Avery Gunther (whose children I used to babysit) agreed to a quid \npro quo exchange of financial compensation for help destroying my credibility on behalf of IBM \nagainst whom I'd filed a 2010 EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) charge and a \nsubsequent May 2011 civil suit. \nPer the May 11, 2011 Complaint, McGuire v. John and Avery Gunther: \n3. On April 6, 2011 Mr. and Mrs Gunther, with uncontrolled greed and total disregard for the rights \nand feelings of Ms. Nadine McGuire as well as those of their children, AFG and XWG, maliciously \nand with ill-intent, wrongfully completed and executed a Complaint and Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction requesting formal protection against Ms. Nadine McGuire. \n4. Over the course of the previous few months, Mr. and Mrs. Gunther, colluding with persons against \nwhom Ms. Nadine McGuire is currently furthering litigation, including but not limited to plaintiff's \nmother, Pauline Scala McGuire, and from whom they received and/or have been promised to receive \nmonetary incentives, hid their relationships with said individuals, further lied about having those \nrelationships in direct conversation with Ms. Nadine McGuire and Court testimony on May 4, 2011, \nand wrongfully completed and executed a Complaint and Motion for Preliminary Injunction against \nMs. Nadine McGuire in cooperation and collaboration with said persons, resulting in the issuance of \na Temporary Restraining Order against Ms. Nadine McGuire issued on April 6, 2011. \n- Initial Complaint, 5/11/11, McGuire v. John and Avery Gunther, Case No.:2011 CA 003703 B, DC \nSuperior Court, Judge Gregory Jackson presiding \nIn regards to the suit against IBM (McGuire v. IBM, 1:11CV528, US District Court of Virginia), the \nonly suit in which Pauline Scala McGuire was listed as a defendant, the most important claim was \none of \"assault\" that led to the 2007 death of my son. Per the filing: \nPlaintiff, Grace Nadine McGuire, realleges the allegations of paragraphs 1-65 hereof as if fully set \nforth within and further alleges: \n66. Defendant Palmisano's conduct in ascertaining the drug that was used on the plaintiff to end her \npregnancy and take the life of her child on April 22, 2007, constitutes an intentional touching of the \nplaintiff by defendant Palmisano, and was undertaken deliberately and with actual malice towards \nthe plaintiff and her unborn child. \n67. Defendant Skoog, Susan Horton and Scala's conduct in coordinating the circumstances, creating \nphysical proximity and the administering of the drug to the plaintiff that ended her pregnancy and \ntook the life of her child on April 22, 2007 constituted an intentional touching of the plaintiff by said \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 015023 \ndefendants, and was undertaken deliberately and with actual malice towards the plaintiff and her \nunborn child. \n... 69. As the direct and proximate result of defendant Palmisano, Skoog, Susan Horton, and Scala's \nconduct, the plaintiff suffered a severe placental abruption, which terminated her pregnancy and \nended the life of her unborn child, causing the plaintiff to suffer damages including but not limited to \nthe loss of her child, loss of affection, grief, sorrow, extreme mental torment and emotional distress. \n- Initial Complaint, filed 5/16/11, McGuire v. IBM, et al, Case No.: 1:11CV528, US District Court of \nVirginia - Eastern Division, Alexandria, Judge Leonie Brinkema presiding \nThis is to say that John and Avery Gunther helped IBM defend against an allegation of murder, and \nin this way they are accomplices to a cover-up. This is also to say that the characterization provided \nby John and Avery Gunther in their April 2011 Superior Court filing for a Protection Order against me \nand their admissions in this filing of having provided derogatory information to various persons \nand/or entities in the DC area to include school administrators, psychologists, and law enforcement, \nwere more to harm me, especially in my chances to hold IBM accountable, than to protect either \nthemselves or children Anjulee and Xian Gunther. \nI also long-allege that the relationship that developed from this initial quid pro quo led to John and \nAvery Gunther being similarly compensated for what turned into the sexual exploitation of their two \ndaughters. For more on child sexual exploitation for the sake of personal and professional leverage, \nsee especially the following: \nNick Bryant I The Franklin Scandal & The Elite's Pedophilia Cover Up, \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68gyGGPjmOo&t=978s  \nThat the NSF won't acknowledge the abuse, and won't respond even to my FOIA requests, and \notherwise has gone to extents to protect Cathie Skoog and her co-conspirators at IBM and otherwise \nis all that was needed to have adequately turned the organization towards the interests of the Deep \nState. Now it is simply a matter of the Deep State continuing to put the NSF to use. \n* \n* \nJeffrey Epstein in context: \n(As sent to the Wash Post) \nI send you this in response to the recent column entitled Believe in the Process by Kenneth Starr. \nPerhaps rethink any public affiliation with Ken Starr; although his demeanor on paper is undoubtably \nconsoling, it is also a bit intoxifying when it would be best now if we keep our wits about us, no? \nI say this from the following perspective - Ken Starr of the Starr Report, attorney for (1) Erik Prince of \nBlackwater and (2) convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein in context: \nThe Starr Report buried behind salacious detail of the Lewinsky affair almost nothing of Whitewater, \nTravelgate, or otherwise what many consider the murder of Vince Foster (Foster, albeit the subject \nof a different investigation was also under the purview of attorney Starr and formal investigation of \nthe results of Starr's investigation were drowned out by the details of the Lewinsky affair.) This is a \nbit strange considering the Lewinsky affair was a moral failing and not an actionable criminal one as \nwould have been the others had any proof surfaced. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 015024 \nStarr later defended Blackwater against wrongful deaths suit initiated by the families of the 2004 \nFallujah Ambush victims - \"In October 2006, Blackwater hired one of the nation's heaviest-hitting \nlawyers to represent it - Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel in the 1999 impeachment of \nPresident Bill Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal... Starr and his colleagues argued that \nBlackwater was \"constitutionally immune\" from such lawsuits and said that if the Fallujah case were \nallowed to proceed, \"Blackwater will suffer irreparable harm.\" In the eighteen-page petition to the \nSupreme Court, Blackwater argued that there are no other such lawsuits against private \nmilitary/security companies in state courts \"because the comprehensive regulatory scheme enacted \nby Congress and the President grant military contractors like Blackwater immunity from state-court \nlitigation.\" (pp. 234-235, Blackwater). (Author Ken Davis writes) \"The four men had spent the night \nbefore they set off at marine base Camp Fallujah. But the men kept their distance from the \nleathernecks. Had they spoken to the marines, the Blackwater team might have learned that the \nAmericans were already in the midst of a major offensive meant to assert control over the \nincreasingly restive city, where elements of the radical Islamist movement and remnants of \nSaddam's army were beginning to aggressively strike back. at the American occupation\" (p. 306, \nThe Hidden History of American at War), and perhaps this is the only thing that makes sense of the \nfact that \"Under the terms of its contract, Blackwater was supposed to supply these convoy security \nmissions with two SUVs, each carrying three guards per vehicle; a driver, one man riding shotgun, \nand a third man in back with a heavy machine gun. Instead, the foursome set out that morning with \njust two men per car, each vehicle missing their rear gunner. The SUVs were only outfitted with a \nsteel plate as extra armor. And the men had not been given maps.\" (p. 305). \nStarr went on to defend Jeffrey Epstein abasing allegations of child sex trafficking - \"Along with a \ndream team of attorneys that included Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, and Ken Starr, [Alan Dershowitz] \nwas successful in getting federal investigators not to charge Epstein with moving his victims across \nstate lines and other associated crimes. The federal non-prosecution agreement Epstein's legal team \nnegotiated with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida immunized all named and \nunnamed \"potential co-conspirators\" in Epstein's child trafficking network, which includes those who \nallegedly procured minors for Epstein and also any powerbrokers who may have molested them\" (-\nhttp://dawker.com/flioht-loos-put-clinton-dershowitz-on-ped...). Otherwise, Epstein's eventual 18 \nmonth sentence by the state of Florida was exceptionally light under the circumstances to include \nthe number of victims who came forward with testimony. This is best understood in the context of \nchildren being used as a means to government-sponsored sexual blackmail and other forms of \nleverage. \nSee here Erik Prince in greater context: (the similarities between him and once (secretly) favored \nchild Bin Laden) \nThe coordinations among global intelligence to make rather than eliminate terror as seen thru \n\"assets\" bin Laden (as M. Noriega before him) & Erik Prince: \nAbout BL: \"Some CIA officers will later say that [BL] serves as a semi-official liaison between the GIP \n[Saudi intel.] and warlords like Sayyaf.\" \n(www.historycommons.ord/entity.isp?entity=ahmed badeeb 1) \nAbout EP: \"Handcuffed by politics, the CIA had not been able to cultivate relationships with the key \nbut messy leaders. Fortunately, Blackwater had no such political restrictions.\" (p. 54, Civilian \nWarriors by E. Prince) \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 015025 \nWe see also: \nAbout BL: \"Bin Laden established camps inside Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan and trained \nvolunteers from across the Muslim world to fight against the Soviet-backed regime, the Democratic \nRepublic of Afghanistan\" (Wikipedia) \nAbout EP: \"In his autobiography, he states that during the Yugoslav Wars in the early 1990s, he \nrealized the need for private training facilities for special operations... Prince moved to Virginia \nBeach and personally financed the formation of Blackwater Worldwide in 1997. He bought 6,000 \nacres (24 km2) of the Great Dismal Swamp of North Carolina and set up a school for special \noperations\" (Wikipedia) \nErik Prince is (becoming) no less an Amer. intelligence success story than bin Laden (in support of \nTerrorism as Geostrategy & a New World Order - see below). In short: (we note the repeating 9/11s, \nevery 11 years): \"Toward a NWO\" speech by Bush #41 - Sept. 11 ('90); The WTC - Sept. 11 ('01); \nBenghazi - Sept. 11 ('12). (There is rhy. & reason also 2 the rise of ISIS.) \n*** \nAbout training camps: \nI watched so to speak the creating of little torture pockets around the world as justified by Obama's \ndesire to close Gitmo. The White House reports (2/23/16): \"We'll continue to securely and \nresponsibly transfer to other countries the 35 detainees already approved for transfer. This process \ninvolves extensive and careful coordination across our federal government to ensure that our \nnational security interests are met when an individual is transferred to another country. We insist, for \nexample, that foreign countries institute strong security measures.\" But are these not just the seeds \nof new training camps (growing concentrated and lauded violent temperaments) & was that not \nsomeone's exact intent? \nIn real-time (and as perpetrated on captured children): \n3/19/14, sent to the now defunct FB page of D. Cheney: \nDick Cheney, \nI wonder if it's possible that there is coordination with other countries concerning enhanced \ninterrogation techniques, in the form of training perhaps? \nSpecifically, here in the United States, my sense is that there may be the use of vulnerable \npopulations, with the intension to gain favor with and/or intimidate others, especially members of the \ninternational community. \nAnd: \nOn Saturday, June 21, 2014 6:37 AM, wrote: \nTo: \nDeputy Lyddy, \nHer energy is very weak. She is physically exhausted, VERY sleep deprived, and HUNGRY. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 015026 \n[These were continuing experimentations in reversed-engineered SERE; the agreed upon \ntechniques, taken from various regions of the world to be distributed to the various regions of the \nworld, had to be deemed not torture and this is where organizations like the APA stepped in, then \n(during the Bush administration), and afterwards. See here for example: \"And I think, you know, \nwhat's really important in the debate going forward among psychologists is the extent to which \npsychologists loaned their names and loaned their credentials and their Ph.D.s to this kind of activity \nand essentially were used by the Bush administration to provide a kind of \"get out of jail free\" card for \nthe people who were, you know, doing these interrogations, because the logic, which I think Mark \nhad mentioned, is, you know, this circular logic. So long as there are trained psychologists from \nthe SERE program who are on site at these interrogations who are saying that these detainees can \nwithstand this treatment, are not being harmed psychologically, then it's not torture. So, you know, \nyou've got this sort of [inaudible] tortured — tortured logic, which is the phrase that has come up, but \nit's this sort of self-justifying loop in which professionals are loaning their credentials to this kind of \nactivity. And you see the same thing in the Office of Legal Counsel, where you have, you know, \nlawyers loaning their credentials to approving what are clear violations of the Geneva Conventions.\" \n(https://www.democracynow.orq/2009/4/21/the story of mitchell lessen associates)] \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

The U.S. \nJustice Department has sued to block that deal. \nIn a report on Cohen's company, Avenatti's law firm said that Novartis in late 2017 and early \n2018 made four separate payments to Essential Consultants totaling nearly $400,000. \n\"Following these payments, reports surfaced that Mr. Trump took a dinner with the \nincoming CEO of Novartis before Mr. Trump's speech at the World Economic Forum in \nDavos, Switzerland in late January 2018,\" Avenatti's report said. \nThat CEO, Vas Narasimhan, was joined with a group of other companies' executives at that  \ndinner.  \nA Novartis spokesperson said in a statement that \"any agreements with Essential Consultants \nwere entered before our current CEO taking office in February of this year and have \nexpired. \nAvenatti's report says another company, Korea Aerospace Industries LTD, paid Essential \nConsultants $150,000 in November 2017. \nAvenatti's client Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was paid $130,000 by \nEssential Consultants on the eve of the 2016 presidential election. \nDaniels says the money was in exchange for her signing a deal that required her to remain \nsilent about an affair she claims to have had with Trump in 2006, shortly after the birth of \nhis youngest son. \nThe White House has denied that Trump had sex with the adult film actress. \nNeither the White House nor Cohen had an immediate comment on Avenatti's new \nallegations about payments to Cohen's company. \nII \nWATCH: Feds saw log of Cohen's phone calls \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 016219 \nRichard Kahn \nHBRK Associates Inc. \n575 Lexington Avenue, 4th Floor \nNew York, NY 10022 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 016220 \n",

[jeeyacation@gmail.com] \nOpportunity Zones \nimage001.jpg; image002.jpg; image003.jpg; image004.jpg \nImportance: High \nHope all well, are you doing anything around these or clients? \nIn a former warehouse on a dimly lit street in the South Bronx, developers sipping Puerto \nRican moonshine listened as a local official urged them to capture a new U.S. tax break by \nrebuilding the decaying neighborhood. \nIn Alabama, a young lawyer quit his job after seeing the same tax break's potential to help \none of the nation's poorest states. He now spends his days driving his Hyundai from town \nto town, slideshow at the ready, hoping to connect investors with communities. \nAnd on a conference call with potential clients, a prominent hedge fund executive pitched \ninvestments in a boutique hotel in Oakland, which he described as San Francisco's \nBrooklyn. The project is eligible for the same tax break, designed to help the poor. \nBetting on Opportunity Zones \nSales of development sites are surging in areas eligible for tax breaks \nSource: Real Capital Analytics \nFervor about opportunity zones is heating up across the U.S. For a limited time, investors \nwho develop real estate or fund businesses in these areas are able to defer capital gains on \nprofits earned elsewhere and completely eliminate them on new investments in 8,700 low-\nincome census tracts. The goal is to reinvigorate these areas. But the question is whether \nthe 2017 tax law will, as U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin predicts, pump $100 \nbillion into places that need it most, or if investors will play it safe by funding projects in a \nfew zones already on the upswing. \nQuicktakeWill 'Opportunity Zones' Help the Rich, the Poor or Both?  \nThere's no lack of optimism among officials in shrinking Rust Belt towns, wind-swept \nWestern landscapes and hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, who hope to jump-start local \neconomies. The incentives are so flexible they could be used for everything from affordable \nhousing to solar farms. \nYet on the investor side, much of the attention is fixed on how to turn a profit in already \nthriving areas. They include neighborhoods surrounding Manhattan, Atlantic beach towns  \ndrawing vacation-home developers, bedroom communities near Silicon Valley and \nanomalies like Portland, Oregon, where the entire downtown was deemed eligible for the \nbreaks. \n\"The phrase I keep thinking of is 'gold rush,' \" said Michael Lortz, an accountant who \nworks with developers in Portland. \"There's a lot of money from out of town that's coming \nhere.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 016413 \nAlready, a policy debate is raging. Backers are urging people to reserve judgment and say \nthe tax breaks have galvanized cities, businesses and investors to think creatively about \nboosting parts of the country most in need. Critics say the incentives were poorly \ncalibrated and may amount to a boondoggle far in excess of the official $1.6 billion \nprojected cost. \nAmericans may have to wait months or years to learn which side is right. That's because \nthe law doesn't require investors to disclose projects, making it difficult to tell which areas \nare benefiting the most. \nBut there's plenty of evidence that a boom is brewing. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which \nalready had an investment team focusing on struggling communities, has disclosed about \n$150 million in projects in recent months. Purchases of sites inside opportunity zones \nspiked as the tax law took effect, outpacing growth in other areas, according to Real \nCapital Analytics, which tracks property sales. Altogether, investors spent 62 percent more \non properties eligible for tax breaks in the 12 months through September, compared with \nthose in the same census tracts a year earlier, its data show. \nHere are snapshots of what's happening across America: \nBronx Boost \nPort Morris Distillery, which makes a high-alcohol rum called pitorro, was the perfect spot \nfor an opportunity zone pitch. It's on a block with a colorful mural, industrial buildings \nready for loft conversions and views of the Manhattan skyline. Much of the surrounding \nSouth Bronx is now an opportunity zone. \n\"We have always been the most ignored,\" Marlene Cintron, the borough's head of \neconomic development, told an audience of developers and lawyers in November. \"These \nopportunity zones are here for you to take advantage of them.\" \nThe case for the Bronx, where incomes are among the lowest in New York, is that it's the \nlast borough awaiting revitalization. The tax incentives are designed to unleash it. If \ndevelopers can buy at current Bronx prices, before seeing a Brooklyn-like rise, the breaks \nwould be massive. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 016414 \nThe Bronx Tavern and Port Morris Distillery. \nPhotographer: David 'Dee' Delgado/Bloomberg \n\"Huge, huge upside that you're not going to get if you build a strip mall in Topeka,\" said \nTerri Adler, managing partner of law firm Duval & Stachenfeld LLP, who also spoke at the \nevent. \nYet the Bronx faces a formidable problem: It's competing with other zones across the city, \nincluding waterfronts in Brooklyn and Queens with stronger momentum. The tax break \nBronx officials hope will rejuvenate their borough may instead lure more money to what \nlooks like a safer bet across the river. \nIn November, Amazon.com Inc. selected Long Island City for its next headquarters. \nPortions of that Queens neighborhood, including a former plastics factory the retailer \nplans to occupy, are inside opportunity zones, even though they're among the city's fastest-\ngrowing areas. In 2017, more apartments were built there than in any other neighborhood \nin the city. \nDriving Alabama \nAlex Flachsbart, 30, has a lot of time to talk when he's in his SUV crisscrossing Alabama. A \nlawyer who specialized in economic development grants and tax breaks, he quit his job last \nyear to start Opportunity Alabama, aiming to connect capital to worthy projects. For the \npast several months, he's been educating people about opportunity zones, speaking to \nlocal officials, businesses and investors. \n\"I have done the OZ PowerPoint God knows how many times,\" Flachsbart, who grew up in \nthe Bay Area, said from behind the wheel one day in December. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 016415 \nAlex Flachsbart gives a presentation on opportunity zones in Athens, Alabama. \nPhotographer: Nicole Craine/Bloomberg \nWhen he read about opportunity zones in a 2017 draft of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, his \nmind reeled. Here was an uncapped subsidy far more flexible than anything he'd used \nbefore. It could draw investment for an array of projects. He imagined funding startups in \nHuntsville, where NASA's presence has lured a deep bench of talented engineers, and the \nrenovation of an old civic complex in Mobile. \nFlachsbart's nonprofit—which has board members from the state's largest utility and its \nbiggest bank, Regions Financial Corp.—is now in talks for 10 potential projects that need \nmore than $loo million in equity investment, he said. None have been funded yet, but he's \ncertain some will be. Meanwhile, he keeps driving. \nBaltimore Billionaire \nOne of the arguments over opportunity zones is whether the U.S. is handing wealthy \ninvestors and companies big breaks on projects they would've done anyway. One example: \nHedge fund executive and former White House spokesman Anthony Scaramucci plans to \nbuild a \"swank, boutique hotel\" in Oakland. The paperwork for the permit was filed \nmonths before the neighborhood was designated an opportunity zone. \nBut that project pales in comparison to what's happening in Baltimore. More than a year \nbefore President Donald Trump signed the law, real estate developer Steven Siegel helped \nnegotiate one of the largest public financing deals of its kind for a client, a company owned \nby billionaire Kevin Plank, founder of athletic-wear maker Under Armour Inc.  \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 016416 \nPort Covington area of Baltimore. \nPhotographer: Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post via Getty Images \nIn 2016, Baltimore's city council approved a $660 million financing package for a 235-acre \nmixed-use development, including new offices for Under Armour, along the city's \nwaterfront. The area was already designated as an enterprise zone and a brownfield site, \nconnoting additional lucrative tax breaks, and the project attracted a $233 million \ninvestment from Goldman Sachs's urban investment group. \nThen came the opportunity zone designation. \nThe tax break is only supposed to apply to real estate purchased after the law took effect. \nBut lawyers across the country quickly began working around that to get the benefits for \nprojects planned before the law was passed. Many tax experts have recommended sales to \nnew entities. So long as the seller owns no more than 20 percent of the buyer, the \ntransaction counts as arm's-length and qualifies. \nSiegel said his firm, Weller Development, has found enough new investors to comply with \nthe arm's-length requirement. The company has seen so much demand, he said, that he's \nlooking to replicate the project elsewhere. \n\"We've been fielding a lot of inbound interest,\" Siegel said, declining to name cities that \nhave approached him. \"That stimulated us to take this show on the road.\" \nBoulder Balks \nIn mid-December, during a marathon city council meeting that stretched past midnight, \nBoulder became perhaps the first jurisdiction in the country to reject its own opportunity \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 016417 \nzone. Officials in the Colorado town imposed an 18-month moratorium on almost all \ndevelopment in its only census tract earmarked for the incentives. \nThe move highlights how local officials have the power to respond to criticisms of the \nlaw—in this case, that investors may rush to build projects the community doesn't want. \nBoulder has long been a favorite spot for growing companies because people want to live \nthere, thanks to its college-town vibe and quick access to nature. \n\"People think we have too much\" development, said Bob Yates, a council member. \"We're \nnot Detroit.\" \nAn eyebrow salon is surrounded by empty stores at Diagonal Plaza in Boulder. \nPhotographer: Rachel Woolf/Bloomberg \nThough Yates, a former telecom executive, opposed the moratorium and worries it will \nmake things difficult for businesses in the zone, he understands why people in Boulder, a \nliberal enclave, were skeptical of an idea enacted by a Republican Congress. He just wishes \nhis city would take a more measured approach. \nThe zone includes an aging mall called Diagonal Plaza. The tax incentives could have \nspurred investors to redevelop it to include affordable housing, which is sorely needed, he \nsaid. \n\"Boulder's teachers can't live in Boulder,\" he said. \"It's not a healthy thing to have \nsocioeconomic divide where lower-income people have to live outside of town to serve \nhigher-income people in town.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 016418 \nPaul V.

It offers timely \ncommentary that can help you navigate markets and take \nadvantage of emerging trends across the globe. \nThis week's topics are: \n• Macro Strategy: Why 2%? — While Federal \nReserve policy has always been focused on the goal of \nprice stability, the specific meaning of price stability has \nbeen refined over the years from a general and non-\nspecified, vague concept to the current very specific \nquantitative definition of a 2% long-run average for the \npersonal consumption expenditures deflator. We describe \nthe evolution and rationale for the more specific target. \n• Global Market View: Global R&D: From Apollo, \nto Apple, to Alibaba? — The recent unfolding tech cold \nwar between the U.S. and China will likely only accelerate \nthe pace of spending on global research and development \nas the two parties vie for technological supremacy. China \nfaces significant technological hurdles, while the U.S. \nneeds to rethink and rebalance the role of public and \nprivate sector research and development spending. \n• Thought of the Week: A Golden Diversifier — \nGold's recent outperformance versus the U.S. dollar has \npotentially triggered a bullish technical pattern.

In addition to these drivers, we view gold as an \nappealing diversifier in light of elevated geopolitical risks. \nHowever, a comprehensive trade deal between the U.S. \nand China would likely constitute a more significant \nheadwind for the yellow metal. \nFind out more in this edition of Capital Market Outlook, \nand feel free to contact us with any questions you have \nabout our market views. \nSincerely, \nPaul \nThis material was prepared by the Chief Investment Office (CIO) and is not a publication of BofA Merrill \nLynch Global Research.

Especially last night Mr. \nBeckler, as most Friday nights, no? \nYes, they are the new iterations of Ghislaine Maxwell; for you Richard Beckler, this originated from \nmy being a former Stone Ridge classmate of his elder daughter Katie Beckler, and because he was \non the Board of Stone Ridge during this period in time when my every family, friend, acquaintance \nand association was being contacted, bribed in one form or another, and turned against me (see \nbelow); as for Ken Adams, it stemmed from my having contacted him for representation in my 2011-\nfiled case against IBM also during this period of time when my every communication were being \ntracked. \nYou both are interesting; you let us see what's to become of the Scalia 35 (see below; at bottom, \nGhislaine Maxwell's Jeffrey Epstein in context.) \nWe start from this following precept: (the repeating 9/11s) \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 017590 \n1. \"Toward a New World Order\" speech by Pres. George H.W. Bush — 9/11 (1990) \n2. WTC Attack — 9/11 (2001) \n3. BENGHAZI Attack — 9/11 (2012) \nBut you have to remember that H. W. Bush was planted: \nAUTHOR PETER DALE SCOTT: Sometimes you have little deep events that most people don't even \nnotice. One of those would be the Halloween Massacre. The older people remember the Saturday \nNight Massacre which happened under Nixon. I'm talking about the Halloween Massacre of October \n31, 1975, and probably people watching this show have never heard of it. \nThat was under Ford, and Ford may have condoned it because it was trying to help restore his \npopularity. He was going way down in the polls. But it was a very important series of events all on \nthe same night. The head of the CIA was fired, William Colby, replaced by a relatively unknown man \ncalled George H. W. Bush who then went on to authorize something that Colby had refused to \nauthorize - the Team B report - the Team B to recalculate the Soviet threat and it was pre-\ndetermined. They were going to find that it was much bigger than the professionals angled like \nRaymond [inaudible] that I mentioned. \nThey said Russia is less of a threat now than it used to be. Well, that was terrible news for the \nindustrial complex so the Team B came in and said oh, no, no, no, it's much more of a threat than it \nused to be, and that's why we got this huge military build-up. It started actually under Carter but we \nthink of it as the Reagan build-up, and that of course is a major factor in having ended the Soviet \nUnion because the Soviet Union tried to match it with a weaker economy. And that arms race which \nwas not about threats but was about fighting economic war, that was an arms race which you could \nsay that the Soviet Union lost because they couldn't keep it up. Their economy went more and more \ndownhill because they were deflecting resources away from vital domestic functions. But really I'm \ntrying to talk here about the Halloween Massacre... \nJust the change in the CIA was a major historical event but it wasn't very visible. The second thing \nthat happened was they fired Jim Schlesinger as Secretary of Defense... It was being done by \n[President Ford's] Chief of Staff and his assistant who are two names barely known then but quite \nfamous since. Chief of staff was Donald Rumsfeld and the assistant was Dick Cheney. And that was \nthe first real intrusion of the Rumsfeld-Cheney team into American politics. And they became the real \nheart of what I consider the Deep State in the 1980s when they were planning for Continuity of \nGovernment which was a plan for emergency rules like warrantless surveillance and warrantless \ndetention and the militarization of homeland security. All those things were planned all through the \n'80s - COG planning by Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney. Even when Rumsfeld wasn't in the \ngovernment, he was authorized by Reagan to do this planning. \nAnd why is that important to our history? Because in 2001, these two men were now in the \ngovernment - Vice President and Secretary of Defense - the two top people in Washington on \nSeptember the 11th, 2001 when Bush was down in Florida - George W. Bush - and what did they do \non that day? They implemented the plans they had been planning for 20 years. Another major event \nin American history but it's not usually told that way. \nWe implemented - it's in the 9/11 Commission Report that COG plans were implemented on that \nday. This is a huge change in our country. We now have an ARMY command, NORTHCOM, to take \ncharge of America - North America, the way SOUTHCOM is in charge of South America and \nCENTCOM is in charge of Central Asia. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 017591 \nThis used to be illegal... We had the posse comitatus acts which said, yes, if there's a real \nemergency you could call up the ARMY to deal with the emergency, but you cannot do it on a \npermanent basis but we now do do it on a permanent basis. We haven't even bothered to repeal the \nposse comitatus. We are in a state of emergency that was declared on September the 14th, 2001. \nAnd it's still enforced. It has to be renewed every year. Obama did it every year just as George Bush \nrenewed it every year. \nWhat are the roots of this? Well there are the legitimate roots that go back to fear of an atomic \ndecapitation of the government back in the Truman era, so legitimate COG planning goes back to \nTruman and Eisenhower, but the illegitimate use of COG to deal with any emergnecy you like, that \ngoes to the Reagan administration and it really goes back to the [Halloween] Massacre where \nRumsfeld and Cheney put their thumbprint on American politics for the first time. \n-- interview of Peter Dale Scott, @ min. 32:00, \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNqDAYWYFuQ&t=2433s \nThis all suggests that the start of the 9/11 agenda pre-dated him as well. I see now that there was a \nseemingly relevant 1990 event as well. \"On September 11, 1970 -- a date that only took on haunting \novertones with the attacks on New York and Washington in 2001 -- Nixon became the first U.S. \npresident to try to protect air travelers from extremists who sensed gaping vulnerabilities in security \nfor commercial airliners, issuing a statement listing a string of measures including the introduction of \n100 air marshals on U.S. planes. \"Most countries, including the United States, found effective means \nof dealing with piracy on the high seas a century and a half ago,\" Nixon said. \"We can -- and we will - \n- deal effectively with piracy in the skies today.\" \nThe President had been jolted into action by the simultaneous hijackings of planes in Europe headed \nto the United States. Jets belonging to TWA, Pan Am and Swissair were seized by the Popular Front \nfor the Liberation of Palestine. The group also attempted to hijack a jet over London belonging to the \nIsraeli airline El Al but was thwarted by security guards on board. \nThe Pan Am seizure ended quickly, but the passengers on the TWA and Swissair jets were diverted \nto a British air base in Jordan and the drama only ended after days of tense diplomacy, when the \nhostages were all released in a deal in which the Swiss, German, British and Israeli governments let \nPalestinian prisoners go.\" (http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/27/politics/terrorism-1970s-richard-\nnixon/index.html) \nThis 9/11 response sounds quite normal of course. But fast forward and the two secret service \nindividuals chosen for an April 2001 interview by a PWC staff member on behalf of what becomthe \nIBM Center for the Business of Government were (1) Steve Colo who happened to be the head of \nthe division at SAIC that falsely labeled me a threat and added my name to some sort of Do Not \nAdmit list at the end of a 5 month temp assignment in 2005 into early 2006. The consequence of the \nSAIC designation for me was the following: \n(I write) \"The SAIC designation took advantage of a devilish stratagem in which as a national \nsecurity employee (having filed out a SF-86 form, governed actually by the GSA - \nhttps://www.osa.clov/portal/forms/download/116390 - for government clearance) working a \ndesignated contract in a classified facility, being designated a disturbance/dissident/threat to \noperations, makes one, in turn, a threat to national security - with all the surveillance/targeting that \nenables.\" In essence I was made an enemy of the State and was tracked, my family and friends \nturned, my opportunities seized to include the opportunity to rear family as demonstrated especially \nin the 2007 sabotage of my third trimester pregnancy and then the targeting and eventual capture of \nchildren I used to babysit - in 2011, they were predominantly tweens - to be used for sexual \nblackmail and other forms of leverage. The reason for the use of children in this barbaric way was to \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 017592 \nexpend \"ops\" that were already in effect and had been used to control many of the politicians that \nhave been allowed to rise to the top (see info on the Franklin Scandal for example), and similarly \naccording to the laws of compromise, the following which has been recently developing into highly \ncoordinated murder \"ops\": \n(I write) \"The progress that was made from the absorbing of my (small) network (and this through \nsources and methods - money and other pleasureful compensations given to those willing to \nparticipate in and/or coordinate violence against me and my loved ones to include children leading \nonly to now their enabled targeting and the absorbing of whatever may be their networks - well, you \nsee below (and this only the very tip of the iceberg) how many people they've been able to engulf \nand what advances have been made by the quite elaborate criminal class employing these tactics; \nand one also begins to better understand the events surrounding Justice Scalia's passing and what's \nto come for the 35 guests in Scalia's private party. As for Scalia's passing, it was decidedly \nsuspicious as noted by William Ritchie: (The Washington Post prints) \"As a former homicide \ncommander, I am stunned that no autopsy was ordered for Justice Scalia,\" William 0. Ritchie, former \nhead of criminal investigations for D.C. police, wrote in a post on Facebook on Sunday... Ritchie also \nraised questions about the marshals' actions: \"How can the Marshal say, without a thorough post \nmortem, that he was not injected with an illegal substance that would simulate a heart attack... Did \nthe US Marshal check for petechial hemorrhage in his eyes or under his lips that would have \nsuggested suffocation? Did the US Marshal smell his breath for any unusual odor that might suggest \npoisoning? My gut tells me there is something fishy going on in Texas.\" \nAs for SAIC, the following also pertains: \n(I write) \"If you first see SAIC as what's called a systems integrator (author Tim Shorrock's phrase), \nand also the formerly married Bud and Sue Horton and their two grown sons Matthew Horton and \nBen Lanier as aids of an implementation, you can better see the bigger picture: \n(1) Sue Horton left IBM in early 2007-ish for an executive position at Tetra Tech which soon entered \ninto joint venture with SAIC (Sue's employer prior to IBM, btw) on an enormous (billion dollar) 2011 \nHillary Clinton State Department award (http://www.prnewswire.com/.../saic-tetra-tech-joint-venture-\na...); \n(2) that Bud Horton left IBM in early 2009-ish for an executive position at Accenture which soon \nthereafter entered into joint venture with SAIC spin-off Leidos, and Cerner, on an enormous (billion \ndollar) 2015 DoD award (http://www.healthcareitnews.com/.../dod-names-ehr-contract-wi...); \n(3) that the Sue Horton contract was used to grow and fortify the Afghan heroin trade (as well as \ncorrupt law enforcement) although the stated intention was of course the opposite... (\"[SAIC and \nTetra Tech's] joint venture, Integrated Justice Systems International, LLC (USD, has been awarded a \ncontract to provide worldwide civilian police and criminal justice assistance to the U.S. Department of \nState's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL)... [specifically} to \nprovide INL with program management, criminal justice, and life and mission support to countries \nemerging from conflict or otherwise facing instability challenges. Under this new contract, IJSI will \nprovide technical assistance, training, logistics and infrastructure services to support the Department \nof State's efforts to strengthen criminal justice systems in select partner countries.\")... yet, just \nmonths shy of contract end, the NY Times reported: \"Tasked With Combating Opium, Afghan \nOfficials Profit From It:\" \"Penetrating Every Stage of Afghan Opium Chain, Taliban become a Cartel:\" \nand \"Corrupt Combatants Fight for Control of Lucrative Afghan Drug Trade:\" see also here an \noverview of the growth of Afghan opium production from the start of the US occupation (2001) to the \npresent, and especially from contract start (2011) to end (2016): http://www.olobalresearch.ca/the-\nspoils-of-war-afohanist.../91; \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 017593 \n(4) and that the award Bud Horton helped secure just as Sue's contract was coming to an end was \nnot only born from what looks like Franklin Scandal compromises, but it is this contract that seems \nintent on implementing bioterrorism as the new form of explosive terrorism.\" \n(Note that both members of this family were awarded BILLION dollar contracts; that's quite \nexceptional, no?) \nAs for terrorism as an US industry, it's hardly better seen than through the following which is \ninformation of course we all know: \nWe note that in-between Bush #41's 9/11/1990 speech(with Dick Cheney as his Secretary of \nDefense) and the 9/11/2001 attack on the WTC were little more than Clinton's 8 years in the White \nHouse. We look also to The American Deep State by Peter Dale Scott for evidence of ties between \nthe actions of the Clinton administration and (1) the 1993 attack on the WTC and (2) the 1998 attack \non the US embassy in Nairobi, Kenya which demonstrate that the Clinton administration in no \nuncertain terms sponsored terrorism: \n(Writes Scott) \"The homicidal crime suggested by Fenton's meticulous research is one both difficult \nand painful to contemplate. It has to be considered in the light of the earlier instances of protection \nwe have surveyed: \n1. the protection given to Salameh and Abouhalima in the 1990 Kahane murder, leaving them free to \nparticipate in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; \n2. the failure for two or three years to process Ali Mohamed's documents seized in 1990, which \ncould have prevented the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; \n3. the release of Ali Mohamed from Royal Canadian Mounted Police detention in 1993, leaving him \nfree to participate in the 1998 Nairobi Embassy bombing; \n4. the treatment of Ali Mohamed as an \"unindicted coconspirator\" in the 1993 WTC bombing case \nand Landmarks case, leaving him free to participate in the 1998 Nairobi Embassy bombing. \n(pp. 76-77, The American Deep State) \nScott had earlier examined these attacks in especial connection to the September 11, 2001 attack \non the WTC: \n(Writes Scott) \"For indeed it is certain that on various occasions U.S. agencies have intervened, \nletting al-Qaeda terrorists proceed with their plots. This alarming statement will be dismissed by \nsome as \"conspiracy theory.\" Yet in this chapter, I will show that this claim doesn't to arise from \ntheory, but from facts that are true, even though they have been systemically suppressed or under-\nreported in the American mainstream media. I am describing a phenomenon that occurred not just \nonce, but repeatedly, almost predictably. We shall see that, among the al-Qaeda terrorists who were \nfirst protected and then continued their activities were the following: \n1. Ali Mohamed, identified in the 9/11 Commission Report as the leader of the 1998 Nairobi \nEmbassy bombing; \n2. Mohammed Jamal Khalife, Osama bin Laden's close friend and, while in the Philippines, financier \nof both Ramzi Yousef (principal architect of the first World Trade Center [WTC] attack) and his uncle \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 017594 \nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed; \n3. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, identified in the 9/11 Commission Report as \"the principal architect of \nthe 9/11 attacks\"; \n4. Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, two of the alleged 9/11 hijackers, whose presence in the \nUnited States was concealed from the FBI by CIA officers for months before 9/11. \nIt might sound from these citations that the 9/11 Commission marked a new stage in the U.S. \ntreatment of these terrorists, and that the report now exposed those terrorists who in the past had \nbeen protected. On the contrary, a principal purpose of my chapter is to show that \n1. one purpose of protecting these individuals had been to protect a valued intelligence connection \n(the \"al-Qaeda connection,\" if you will); \n2. one major intention of the 9/11 Commission Report was to continue protecting this connection; \n3. those on the 9/11 Commission staff who were charged with this protection included at least one \ncommission member (Jamie Gorelick), one staff member (Dietrich Snell), and one important witness \n(Patrick Fitzgerald) who earlier had figured among the terrorists' protectors. \nIn the course of writing this chapter [Scott continues], I came to another disturbing conclusion I had \nnot anticipated. This is that a central feature of the protection has been to defend the 9/11 \nCommission's false picture of al-Qaeda as an example of non-state terrorism, ignoring not just the \nCIA but also the royal families of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. In reality, as I shall show, royal family \nprotection from Qatar and Saudi Arabia (concealed by the 9/11 Commission) was repeatedly given \nto key figures like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged \"principal architect of the 9/11 attacks.\" The \nestablishment claims that the wars fought by America in Asia since 9/11 have been part of a global \n\"war on terror.\" But this \"war on terror\" has been fought in alliance with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and \nPakistan - precisely the principal political and financial backers of the al-Qaedist networks the United \nStates has supposedly been fighting. Meanwhile the most authentic opponents in the region of these \nSunni al-Qaedists - the governments of Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Iran - have found themselves \noverthrown (in the case of Iraq and Libya), subverted with U.S. support (in the case of Syria), or \nsanctioned and threatened as part of an \"axis of evil\" (in the case of Iran). We should not forget that, \njust one day after 9/11, \"Rumsfeld was talking about broadening the objectives of our response and \n'getting Iraq.\" \n(pp. 44-45, The American Deep State) \nClinton's daughter is now poised to work global health initiatives which I would suggest is little more \nthan a cover for on-going terrorism \"ops\". \nTo return to Steve Colo - in the interview he speaks of a partnership between the Secret Service, the \nFBI, and South Carolina's SLED (State Law Enforcement Division) to open a Computer Crime \nCenter. Bud Horton (mentioned above) (long-affiliated with IT Security; his title at Accenture was \nChief technology officer of it's cyber security practice) happened to have just moved to South \nCarolina from Loudoun County after being implicated in a continuing child sex scandal (see details \nbelow). Further, cyber-crime just so happens to be another of the arenas in which our Intelligence \nCommunity coordinates with the Russians: \"The US cooperates with the FSB and Russia's interior \nministry on counter-terrorism, organized crime, bio-terrorism, and cyber-crime.\" -- p. 243, Expelled: A \nJournalist's Descent into the Russian Mafia State, by Luke Harding) Most would interpret this quote \nto suggest that the nations work together to prevent these various threats. The reality is more the \nopposite; trust me when I say that the US doesn't work \"ops\" alone - the 2005 London Bombings is \none notable example of a instance in which the US coordinated with also British intelligence in the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 017595 \nperpetration of an attack.) I just tweeted this morning actually the following in regards to US \ncoordinations with the Russians: \"One must know a renowned Rus mafiaso was granted entry \nhttps://en.wikipedia.orcilwiki/Vyacheslay Ivankov#Movinq to the United States ... be4 the real \nstory of today's US-Rus relations is slowly known\" in response to the following comment \n@turndeaux: Peter Dale Scott, who writes about the Deep State, says Russia issue is \"a bona fide \nsecurity issue, not a diversion\". \nAbout Bud Horton and the Loudoun County matter - in attempts to make a long story short, the \nfollowing email chain: \nOn Monday, June 26, 2017 10:57 AM, \nSheriff Chapman, \nLoudoun Count, VA \nwrote: \nDid you ever consider that Loudoun was a target? That your community was induced to walk it's own \nchildren down the plank as compensation for what Loudoun had done to the young Dima Yakovlev? \nBecause now child exploitation is deeply embedded within your community with your own people \n(your own police, your own prosecutors, your own public defenders and private attorneys) protecting \nthis very system that will be used to take the futures of your Loudoun children (see more of the \ndetails below). Is it possible that that's how this happened, and you saw it not unfolding before your \neyes?

They're got sort of \ntwo things going on. One is oil and the other is drug trafficking. Halliburton is a story all by itself.\" \n(says Stan Goff, http://narconews.com/qoffmccormick1.html)) \nOn Saturday, June 24, 2017 2:43 PM, \nMr. Satz, \nState's Attorney, Broward County, Fl \nwrote: \nI'm forwarding the below information as it pertains to Mrs. Lesley Simms and more importantly the \nones with whom she continues to coordinate. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 017596 \nAs you may know, she was once close with an individual named Matthew Horton with whom she \nattended George Mason University, and through Matthew, Ms. Simms became well-acquainted with \nMatthew's parents Henry \"Bud\" Horton and Sue Popovich Horton who helped secure her a position \nat IBM upon her graduation from GMU. Both of these latter individuals (Bud and Sue Horton) were \ninvolved in the 2007 murder of my son, and they in collusion with their son Matthew continue in the \nexploitation of children Anjulee and Xian Gunther. The powers that be intend now for these children \nto (continue to) follow in the footsteps of Ms. Simms, and to that end, I would advise that you \nbecome acquainted with (1) the ways in which Ms. Simms subsidized her law school education and \noff course (2) her current and related endeavors especially as they relate to drug trafficking and \nterror financing (see below email to Mr. Martin of the St. Augustine Record). \nOn Friday, June 23, 2017 8:36 AM, \nMr. Martin, \nSt. Augustine Record \nwrote: \nQuite an interesting article about the litigation between Deputy Banks and Rusty Rogers (see: \nDeputy Banks' attorney claims FDLE agent's credibility 'destroyed') It must also be explored, of \ncourse, that Officers Rodgers was once well respected for his investigation and exposure of a \nterrorist financing network that permeated the sunny state of Florida - (the NY Times reports) \"Agent \nRodgers joined the state's elite investigative unit, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, where \nhe quickly earned agent-of-the-year honors — and a meeting with the governor — for helping \ndismantle a terrorist financing network that stretched from Florida to the Middle East\" - and that \nterrorism is very much a well-protected U.S. industry (see below). \nGod forbid some poor should get away with disrupting the delicate state of secreted operations; as \nyou yourself report, \"As written in [Plaintiff Banks] motion: \"Defendant Rodgers' false, misleading \nand inconsistent testimony throughout the discovery process is so pervasive and extreme, and \ninvolves so many material issues, it has destroyed Defendant's credibility on all issues...\" And here \nwe see the \"whole-of-government\" attempts to restore balance. \nAs for the second Secret Service agent interviewed by the IBM Center for the Business of \nGovernment, his name is Dana Brown. He just so happened to have filled out his career with the \nFederal Air Marshall Service (October 2003-August 2008 as Director/Chief of Staff) followed by the \nTSA (March 2006-January 2009 as Asst. Administrator-Law Enforcement/Integrity Officer) states his \nLinked In profile. That he worked his way around to that which was largely put in place by the 1970 \n9/11 mini-event seems to me rather significant although I don't see all the details yet. I also don't yet \nsee exactly who it was that birthed this lengthy 9/11 initiative we're suffering. It seems clear, \nhowever, that it was birthed prior to 1970. \nThe initiative has adjusted in some ways over time, but homage to 9/11 remains strong. Certain of \nthe people deeply involved in these manipulations thought it was kismet that an individual well-suited \nto head the newly ordained Department of Homeland Security (that as we all know was the result of \nlegislation rushed through Congress in the aftermath of the 9/11 (2001) attack) was born on the \nmagical September 11th (this is Jeh Johnson); similarly, it is again being deemed a sign that the new \nDirector of the National Science Foundation (NSF) (chosen and positioned as she was) is first-\nnamed France (last name Cordova) and that this name so perfectly relates to US intentions to use \nthe NSF to forward \"ops\" that will solidify a US-France working relationship in the same way the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 017597 \n2005 London Bombings helped solidify the US-British working relationship. These France going-ons \nare in higher gear (I've noticed) since Macron was elected but it was prepped for long ago. I was \nworking for IBM under IBM project manager Cathie Skoog at the NSF when my third trimester \npregnancy was sabotaged. The story of this sabotage and what followed is (briefly) this: \nI've long-alleged that John and Avery Gunther (whose children I used to babysit) agreed to a quid \npro quo exchange of financial compensation for help destroying my credibility on behalf of IBM \nagainst whom I'd filed a 2010 EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) charge and a \nsubsequent May 2011 civil suit. \nPer the May 11, 2011 Complaint, McGuire v. John and Avery Gunther: \n3. On April 6, 2011 Mr. and Mrs Gunther, with uncontrolled greed and total disregard for the rights \nand feelings of Ms. Nadine McGuire as well as those of their children, AFG and XWG, maliciously \nand with ill-intent, wrongfully completed and executed a Complaint and Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction requesting formal protection against Ms. Nadine McGuire. \n4. Over the course of the previous few months, Mr. and Mrs. Gunther, colluding with persons against \nwhom Ms. Nadine McGuire is currently furthering litigation, including but not limited to plaintiff's \nmother, Pauline Scala McGuire, and from whom they received and/or have been promised to receive \nmonetary incentives, hid their relationships with said individuals, further lied about having those \nrelationships in direct conversation with Ms. Nadine McGuire and Court testimony on May 4, 2011, \nand wrongfully completed and executed a Complaint and Motion for Preliminary Injunction against \nMs. Nadine McGuire in cooperation and collaboration with said persons, resulting in the issuance of \na Temporary Restraining Order against Ms. Nadine McGuire issued on April 6, 2011. \n- Initial Complaint, 5/11/11, McGuire v. John and Avery Gunther, Case No.:2011 CA 003703 B, DC \nSuperior Court, Judge Gregory Jackson presiding \nIn regards to the suit against IBM (McGuire v. IBM, 1:11CV528, US District Court of Virginia), the \nonly suit in which Pauline Scala McGuire was listed as a defendant, the most important claim was \none of \"assault\" that led to the 2007 death of my son. Per the filing: \nPlaintiff, Grace Nadine McGuire, realleges the allegations of paragraphs 1-65 hereof as if fully set \nforth within and further alleges: \n66. Defendant Palmisano's conduct in ascertaining the drug that was used on the plaintiff to end her \npregnancy and take the life of her child on April 22, 2007, constitutes an intentional touching of the \nplaintiff by defendant Palmisano, and was undertaken deliberately and with actual malice towards \nthe plaintiff and her unborn child. \n67. Defendant Skoog, Susan Horton and Scala's conduct in coordinating the circumstances, creating \nphysical proximity and the administering of the drug to the plaintiff that ended her pregnancy and \ntook the life of her child on April 22, 2007 constituted an intentional touching of the plaintiff by said \ndefendants, and was undertaken deliberately and with actual malice towards the plaintiff and her \nunborn child. \n... 69. As the direct and proximate result of defendant Palmisano, Skoog, Susan Horton, and Scala's \nconduct, the plaintiff suffered a severe placental abruption, which terminated her pregnancy and \nended the life of her unborn child, causing the plaintiff to suffer damages including but not limited to \nthe loss of her child, loss of affection, grief, sorrow, extreme mental torment and emotional distress. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 017598 \n- Initial Complaint, filed 5/16/11, McGuire v. IBM, et al, Case No.: 1:11CV528, US District Court of \nVirginia - Eastern Division, Alexandria, Judge Leonie Brinkema presiding \nThis is to say that John and Avery Gunther helped IBM defend against an allegation of murder, and \nin this way they are accomplices to a cover-up. This is also to say that the characterization provided \nby John and Avery Gunther in their April 2011 Superior Court filing for a Protection Order against me \nand their admissions in this filing of having provided derogatory information to various persons \nand/or entities in the DC area to include school administrators, psychologists, and law enforcement, \nwere more to harm me, especially in my chances to hold IBM accountable, than to protect either \nthemselves or children Anjulee and Xian Gunther. \nI also long-allege that the relationship that developed from this initial quid pro quo led to John and \nAvery Gunther being similarly compensated for what turned into the sexual exploitation of their two \ndaughters. For more on child sexual exploitation for the sake of personal and professional leverage, \nsee especially the following: \nNick Bryant I The Franklin Scandal & The Elite's Pedophilia Cover Up, \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68gyGGPjmOo&t=978s  \nThat the NSF won't acknowledge the abuse, and won't respond even to my FOIA requests, and \notherwise has gone to extents to protect Cathie Skoog and her co-conspirators at IBM and otherwise \nis all that was needed to have adequately turned the organization towards the interests of the Deep \nState. Now it is simply a matter of the Deep State continuing to put the NSF to use. \n* \n* \nJeffrey Epstein in context: \n(As sent to the Wash Post) \nI send you this in response to the recent column entitled Believe in the Process by Kenneth Starr. \nPerhaps rethink any public affiliation with Ken Starr; although his demeanor on paper is undoubtably \nconsoling, it is also a bit intoxifying when it would be best now if we keep our wits about us, no? \nI say this from the following perspective - Ken Starr of the Starr Report, attorney for (1) Erik Prince of \nBlackwater and (2) convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein in context: \nThe Starr Report buried behind salacious detail of the Lewinsky affair almost nothing of Whitewater, \nTravelgate, or otherwise what many consider the murder of Vince Foster (Foster, albeit the subject \nof a different investigation was also under the purview of attorney Starr and formal investigation of \nthe results of Starr's investigation were drowned out by the details of the Lewinsky affair.) This is a \nbit strange considering the Lewinsky affair was a moral failing and not an actionable criminal one as \nwould have been the others had any proof surfaced. \nStarr later defended Blackwater against wrongful deaths suit initiated by the families of the 2004 \nFallujah Ambush victims - \"In October 2006, Blackwater hired one of the nation's heaviest-hitting \nlawyers to represent it - Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel in the 1999 impeachment of \nPresident Bill Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal... Starr and his colleagues argued that \nBlackwater was \"constitutionally immune\" from such lawsuits and said that if the Fallujah case were \nallowed to proceed, \"Blackwater will suffer irreparable harm.\" In the eighteen-page petition to the \nSupreme Court, Blackwater argued that there are no other such lawsuits against private \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 017599 \nmilitary/security companies in state courts \"because the comprehensive regulatory scheme enacted \nby Congress and the President grant military contractors like Blackwater immunity from state-court \nlitigation.\" (pp. 234-235, Blackwater). (Author Ken Davis writes) \"The four men had spent the night \nbefore they set off at marine base Camp Fallujah. But the men kept their distance from the \nleathernecks. Had they spoken to the marines, the Blackwater team might have learned that the \nAmericans were already in the midst of a major offensive meant to assert control over the \nincreasingly restive city, where elements of the radical Islamist movement and remnants of \nSaddam's army were beginning to aggressively strike back. at the American occupation\" (p. 306, \nThe Hidden History of American at War), and perhaps this is the only thing that makes sense of the \nfact that \"Under the terms of its contract, Blackwater was supposed to supply these convoy security \nmissions with two SUVs, each carrying three guards per vehicle; a driver, one man riding shotgun, \nand a third man in back with a heavy machine gun. Instead, the foursome set out that morning with \njust two men per car, each vehicle missing their rear gunner. The SUVs were only outfitted with a \nsteel plate as extra armor. And the men had not been given maps.\" (p. 305). \nStarr went on to defend Jeffrey Epstein abasing allegations of child sex trafficking - \"Along with a \ndream team of attorneys that included Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, and Ken Starr, [Alan Dershowitz] \nwas successful in getting federal investigators not to charge Epstein with moving his victims across \nstate lines and other associated crimes. The federal non-prosecution agreement Epstein's legal \nteam negotiated with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida immunized all named and \nunnamed \"potential co-conspirators\" in Epstein's child trafficking network, which includes those who \nallegedly procured minors for Epstein and also any powerbrokers who may have molested them\" (-\nhttp://dawker.com/flioht-loos-put-clinton-dershowitz-on-ped...). Otherwise, Epstein's eventual 18 \nmonth sentence by the state of Florida was exceptionally light under the circumstances to include \nthe number of victims who came forward with testimony. This is best understood in the context of \nchildren being used as a means to government-sponsored sexual blackmail and other forms of \nleverage. \nSee here Erik Prince in greater context: (the similarities between him and once (secretly) favored \nchild Bin Laden) \nThe coordinations among global intelligence to make rather than eliminate terror as seen thru \n\"assets\" bin Laden (as M. Noriega before him) & Erik Prince: \nAbout BL: \"Some CIA officers will later say that [BL] serves as a semi-official liaison between the GIP \n[Saudi intell and warlords like Sayyaf.\" \n(www.historycommons.ord/entity.isp?entity=ahmed badeeb 1) \nAbout EP: \"Handcuffed by politics, the CIA had not been able to cultivate relationships with the key \nbut messy leaders. Fortunately, Blackwater had no such political restrictions.\" (p. 54, Civilian \nWarriors by E. Prince) \nWe see also: \nAbout BL: \"Bin Laden established camps inside Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan and trained \nvolunteers from across the Muslim world to fight against the Soviet-backed regime, the Democratic \nRepublic of Afghanistan\" (Wikipedia) \nAbout EP: \"In his autobiography, he states that during the Yugoslav Wars in the early 1990s, he \nrealized the need for private training facilities for special operations... Prince moved to Virginia \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 017600 \nBeach and personally financed the formation of Blackwater Worldwide in 1997. He bought 6,000 \nacres (24 km2) of the Great Dismal Swamp of North Carolina and set up a school for special \noperations\" (Wikipedia) \nErik Prince is (becoming) no less an Amer. intelligence success story than bin Laden (in support of \nTerrorism as Geostrategy & a New World Order - see below). In short: (we note the repeating 9/11s, \nevery 11 years): \"Toward a NWO\" speech by Bush #41 - Sept. 11 ('90); The WTC - Sept. 11 ('01); \nBenghazi - Sept. 11 ('12). (There is rhy. & reason also 2 the rise of ISIS.) \n*** \nAbout training camps: \nI watched so to speak the creating of little torture pockets around the world as justified by Obama's \ndesire to close Gitmo. The White House reports (2/23/16): \"We'll continue to securely and \nresponsibly transfer to other countries the 35 detainees already approved for transfer. This process \ninvolves extensive and careful coordination across our federal government to ensure that our \nnational security interests are met when an individual is transferred to another country. We insist, for \nexample, that foreign countries institute strong security measures.\" But are these not just the seeds \nof new training camps (growing concentrated and lauded violent temperaments) & was that not \nsomeone's exact intent? \nIn real-time (and as perpetrated on captured children): \n3/19/14, sent to the now defunct FB page of D. Cheney: \nDick Cheney, \nI wonder if it's possible that there is coordination with other countries concerning enhanced \ninterrogation techniques, in the form of training perhaps? \nSpecifically, here in the United States, my sense is that there may be the use of vulnerable \npopulations, with the intension to gain favor with and/or intimidate others, especially members of the \ninternational community. \nAnd: \nOn Saturday, June 21, 2014 6:37 AM, wrote: \nTo: \nDeputy Lyddy, \nHer energy is very weak. She is physically exhausted, VERY sleep deprived, and HUNGRY. \n[These were continuing experimentations in reversed-engineered SERE; the agreed upon \ntechniques, taken from various regions of the world to be distributed to the various regions of the \nworld, had to be deemed not torture and this is where organizations like the APA stepped in, then \n(during the Bush administration), and afterwards. See here for example: \"And I think, you know, \nwhat's really important in the debate going forward among psychologists is the extent to which \npsychologists loaned their names and loaned their credentials and their Ph.D.s to this kind of activity \nand essentially were used by the Bush administration to provide a kind of \"get out of jail free\" card for \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 017601 \nthe people who were, you know, doing these interrogations, because the logic, which I think Mark \nhad mentioned, is, you know, this circular logic.

So, you know, \nyou've got this sort of [inaudible] tortured — tortured logic, which is the phrase that has come up, but \nit's this sort of self-justifying loop in which professionals are loaning their credentials to this kind of \nactivity.

If you \nhave been thinking about founding or investing in a technology startup, there is no better time to jump in and \ntake advantage of a recently enacted federal income tax benefit. \nPresident Obama recently signed into law changes to tax law that may, under certain circumstances, exempt \nprofits from investments in startup companies from ALL federal income tax, including alternative minimum \ntax. Yes, that's right, if you start a new company now and sell it more than five years from now and make a $10 \nmillion profit on the sale, you may owe NO federal income taxes on your profit. \nThis special tax benefit will apply only to stock issued to founders or investors between September 28 and \nDecember 31, 2010, so time is of the essence. \nThe founder or investor would have to buy and hold shares of a \"qualified small business\" for five or more \nyears. A \"qualified small business\" is a C corporation engaged in an active trade or business with less than $50 \nmillion in aggregate gross assets. \nIf you satisfy the above requirements and certain other conditions, you may not have to pay federal income \ntaxes on your first $10 million of gain. If there is a liquidity event within five years of your purchase of \nqualified small business stock, you may still be eligible to \"roll over\" any gains from sale of the shares tax-free \nwithin 60 days into another qualified small business. \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

    "email_text": "From: Jeffrey Epstein [jeeyacation@gmail.com] \nSent: 2/15/2013 4:52:58 PM \nTo: Larry Summers \ntake-it-or-leave-it deal by the U.S. on the \nnuclear issue is the wrong strategy  \nRay Takeyh \nFebruary 14, 2013 -- On Feb. 26, the United States and Iran will once \nmore resume their diplomatic ritual, in the so-called six-party talks, over \nIran's disputed nuclear program. As the two perennial adversaries eye one \nanother, there are competing paradigms about how to deal with Tehran. \nAn emerging school of thought suggests that the best means of \"testing\" \nIran is to offer it a final nuclear agreement that presumably promises \nmeasurable relief from sanctions for significant Iranian concessions. Iran's \nfailure to grasp such an offer would then conclusively demonstrate to both \ndomestic and international audiences that the cause of the impasse is not \nAmerican belligerence but Iranian truculence. \nBut this approach fails to recognize that an arms-control process is \nnecessarily an incremental one, nor does it offer a practical substitute to \nthe existing step-by-step diplomacy. \nIran's nuclear program encompasses a vast complex of enrichment \nfacilities, centrifuge construction plants, uranium extraction companies \nand thousands of scientists working in university and government \nlaboratories. Iran is enriching uranium at both 5% and 20% levels, \nexperimenting with high-velocity centrifuges and seemingly in the process \nof constructing additional enrichment facilities. \nSuch a multilayered, multifaceted program can be dealt with only on a \npiecemeal basis, as the technical details and rules for inspections are too \ncomplex to be addressed in a single agreement. \nMoreover, should the United States offer Iran a final deal, Tehran still has \na right to contest and negotiate its provisions and offer counterproposals. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018197 \nThe international community is unlikely to concede to either more \nsanctions or the use of force until Iran's objections are taken into full \nconsideration. As such, a grand deal that is supposed to provoke a moment \nof clarity is likely to be enmeshed in the existing, protracted arms-control \nprocess. \nAnother complication is the advent of public opinion and critical \nconstituencies in Iran devoted to the perpetuation of the program. The \ngrowing public sentiment is that Iran has a right to acquire a nuclear \ncapability. As the program matures, it is becoming a source of pride for a \ncitizenry accustomed to the revolution's setbacks and failures. \nAlso emerging is a bureaucratic and scientific establishment with its own \nparochial considerations for sustaining the nuclear investment. A clerical \nleadership that is dealing with a restive population and empowered \nsecurity services cannot easily dispense with its nuclear trump card. \nAll this suggests that the best means of addressing Iran's nuclear challenge \nis to mitigate its most dangerous dimensions. The focus should remain on \nIran's high-grade enrichment and its underground nuclear facility nestled \nin mountains outside Qom. Tehran seems to have conceived an ingenious \npath to nuclear advancement, one that involves increasing the size and \nsophistication of its civilian atomic apparatus to the point where it can \nquickly surge into a bomb. While staying within the rules of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency's inspection process, Iran is \nessentially expanding its capabilities while shielding them under the \nveneer of legality. Given the fact that much of civilian nuclear technology \ncan easily be misappropriated for military purposes, Iran can construct an \nelaborate nuclear infrastructure while remaining within IAEA guidelines. \nThe diplomatic challenge is to derail this path to a nuclear weapon by \nimposing significant restraints on its program. And this can still be done \nthrough a process that proceeds incrementally and sequentially. \nU.S. officials would be wise to get out of the crisis mode and put some \ntime back on the clock. The Iran issue always seems urgent, and yet \nsomehow there is always time to deal with it. Washington should \nacknowledge the obvious, namely, that given Iran's gradualist approach, it \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018198 \nis still years from completing an efficient enrichment infrastructure, \nconstructing a nuclear arsenal and developing a reliable means of delivery. \nBy agreeing to a compressed timeline, the U.S. only narrows its options \nand makes a solution even more elusive. \nAs the United States again contemplates its Iran conundrum, it should \neschew calls for a take-it-or-leave-it deal. The history of Iran's \nconfrontation with the international community suggests that keeping it a \ncrisis situation benefits the Islamic Republic. Ironically, it is the Western \npowers that have generated alarmist conditions. And then to escape the \npredicament of their own making, they offer Iran more concessions and \nfurther incentives. \nTo avoid a repeat of that outcome, it would be prudent to have a sense of \nproportionality and appreciate that, in the end, time works best for the \nUnited States and not the economically beleaguered theocracy. \nRay Takeyh is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \nArticle 2. \nThe Guardian  \nWhether it's North Korea or Iran, sanctions  \nwon't work  \nSimon Jenkins \n13 February 2013 -- Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinej ad. 'Threats \nand sanctions have not weakened the regime's determination to proceed \n[with nuclear weapons], but rather weakened opposition to it'. Photograph: \nSven Hoppe/EPA \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018199 \nNorth Korea has  set off a third nuclear test explosion. It has done so in \ndefiance of the UN, America, Japan and even, reportedly, its sponsor, \nChina. It has said to hell with everyone, in a brutal comment on western \neconomic sanctions. \nThe UN security council met yesterday and Washington threatened \n\"significant consequences\" — code nowadays for \"tighter sanctions\". Every \nshred of evidence suggests that these will not achieve the declared goal. \nThey will merely add to the impoverishment of North Korea's people by \nits own government. Sanctions are the most counter-productive tool \nknown to diplomacy. Yet we keep imposing them. Why? \nSanctions assume that all countries react to external pressure as might a \ncapitalist democracy. They assume a misguided regime will change its \nmind and put financial advantage above its definition of national interest. \n\"Smart sanctions\" (really dumb sanctions) further assume the rich can be \npunished without punishing the poor, and that all dictators' wives want to \nfly abroad and shop at Harrods. They assume that trade guides political \naction and political action trumps dictatorship. \nEconomic sanctions are hugely popular to western politicians, not because \nof their effect but because of their cause: the desire to stand on an \ninternational stage and being seen to \"do something\". They are the least-\ncost first resort of the laptop bombardiers of global intervention. They \nsound punitive and aggressive without inflicting any hardship on the \nimposer. \nAfter North Korea the other target in the sanctions frame is Iran. \nEverything at present suggests that ever-tighter sanctions have done \nnothing to curb Iran's nuclear programme. Indeed, by inducing paranoia, \nprobably the reverse. Sanctions have certainly \"bitten\", to the glee of their \nadvocates. They have brought inflation and a collapse in the currency, the \nrial. They have harmed ordinary people and solidified sentiment against \nthe west and the \"great Satan\" of the US. Assassination and cyber-\nweapons have wiped out a few scientists and scrambled a few computers. \nWhat sanctions have not done is weakened the power of the ayatollahs or \ntheir private army, the Revolutionary Guards. Both seem as secure as ever, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018200 \nwhile (relatively) moderate civilian politicians are reduced to feuding and \narresting each others' children. Iran's nuclear programme appears to \nproceed independent even of the organs of its own state. \nA spoof article in the Economist last year portrayed Iran's supreme leader, \nAyatollah Khamenei, ruminating on western nations' obsessive posturing \ntowards his country. He mused that these were unstable, unreliable places, \ndangerous though probably not all mad. But since it was hard to be sure, \"I \nwould feel a lot safer if we already had that bomb\". Similar insecurity \ndrove sanctioned Cuba to accept Russian missiles in the 1960s, and \nsanctioned Iraq and Libya to pretend to build weapons of mass destruction \nin the 1990s. \nSanctions never stop bad things happening. Rather they entrench dictators, \nbuild up siege economies and debilitate the urban middle class from which \nopposition to dictatorship grows. As Khamenei said in a speech a year  \nago, sanctions were \"painful ... but make us more self-reliant\". Indeed, for \na regime to be sanctioned is to receive an elixir: witness Castro, Gaddafi, \nthe ayatollahs and the ruling cliques of Burma, Afghanistan and North \nKorea. That sanctioned regimes sometimes come to an end is not proof \nthat sanctions work, rather that they take a long time and usually require \nwar to \"work\". \nThis is a rarely researched topic because sanctions are diplomatic ideology \nrather than science. A debate in 1998 in International Security magazine  \nsaw the Chicago academic, Robert Pape, barely challenged in his view \nthat only around five of the 115 cases of sanctions imposed since the war \ncould claim any plausible efficacy. Most merely inflicted \"significant \nhuman costs on the populations of target states, including on innocent \ncivilians who have little influence on their government's behaviour\". They \nare a ready invitation to war. \nWhen I was reporting on South Africa in the 1980s I became convinced \nthat sanctions were aiding import substitution and benefiting the Afrikaner \neconomy, probably giving apartheid an extra decade of life. They likewise \nprolonged Ian Smith's regime in Rhodesia. Sanctions made Libya's \nGaddafi so rich he could spoon money into the London School of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018201 \nEconomics. They made Saddam Hussein one of the 10 wealthiest people \nin the world. Besides, sanctions create sanctions-busting which, like drugs, \nis a global criminal industry born entirely of the idiocy of western \ndiplomacy. \nA year ago the  Foreign Office defended yet another round of sanctions  \nagainst Tehran on the grounds they would \"hasten Iran's economic \ncollapse and deepen rifts within the regime, in the hope that saner voices \nwill deem the price of pursuing nuclear weapons too high\". Economies \ndon't collapse, any more than poverty changes governments. Even Greece, \nnow the most \"sanctioned\" nation in Europe, has not collapsed. Places just \nget poorer. As for \"saner voices\", they go into exile, hiding or prison. \nThat's where sanctions send them. \nIran is a proud nation of 80 million mostly Muslim people, one of many \nAsian and African states struggling between theocracy and democracy, \ntradition and modernity. These are agonising struggles among and within \npeoples, to which the west has contributed nothing but hostility and \nbelligerence. Under the cloak of \"counter-terror\", it has been as crass as it \nwas during the Crusades. Of course no one wants to see nuclear weapons \nspread. Russia tried to stop China getting them. China tried to stop North \nKorea. The west tried to stop India and Pakistan, while hypocritically \ntolerating Israel and the replenished arsenals of France and Britain. No \npressure made the slightest difference to anyone. \nIf Iran really wants a nuclear weapon, it will get one — the more so when it \nis threatened with dire retribution if it does. That is how such states react \nto pressure. Ever since the dodgy election of 2009, threats and sanctions \nhave not weakened the regime's determination to proceed, but rather \nweakened opposition to it. If ever there was a country unlikely to respond \nto diplomatic bullying, it is Iran. If ever there was a country that might \nrespond to constructive engagement, to commercial, governmental and \ncultural intercourse, it is also Iran. Why the west should want to make it \nanother North Korea passes comprehension. \nArticle 3. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018202 \nThe Washington Institute \nYear of Decision: U.S. Policy toward Iran in  \n2013 \nJames F. Jeffrey and Thomas Pickering  \nFebruary 12, 2013 -- On February 7, 2013, James F. Jeffrey and Thomas \nPickering addressed a Policy Forum at The Washington Institute. \nAmbassador Jeffrey, a former assistant to the president and deputy \nnational security advisor, is author of the new Institute study Moving to  \nDecision: U.S. Policy toward Iran. Ambassador Pickering served in \nnumerous key posts at home and abroad over a five-decade career, \nincluding undersecretary of state for political affairs. The following is a \nrapporteur's summary of their remarks. \nJAMES F. JEFFREY \nThe move to decision on Iran is the most pressing and dangerous issue on \nthe U.S. and international agenda in 2013. The year ahead will largely \ndefine the longstanding struggle between Washington and Tehran, and the \nconsiderable stakes involved make it absolutely crucial that a swift and \ndecisive resolution be achieved. Regardless of the outcome of the nuclear \nissue, however, Iran will continue to present a long-term challenge to the \nUnited States because of clashing ideologies, conflicting foreign policy \ngoals, and Iran's claim to regional hegemony. \nThere are four likely outcomes to the nuclear issue: a unilateral Iranian \ndecision to halt or dramatically slow its progress toward a nuclear weapon; \na negotiated outcome, whether through the P5+1 (i.e., the five permanent \nmembers of the UN Security Council plus Germany) or bilateral \nnegotiations; a military strike, as threatened by President Obama and \nIsraeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu, and an explicit or implicit \nshift to containment, indicating that Washington would be prepared to \ncoexist with a nuclear-armed Iran. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018203 \nThe most effective resolution would be a negotiated outcome -- to achieve \nit, Washington will need to take preliminary steps on several fronts. A \nserious compromise needs to be put on the table, including an offer to \nsuspend crippling oil sanctions in return for specific, verifiable Iranian \nsteps to eliminate any nuclear breakout capabilities. Equally significant is \nestablishing a credible military threat, given that Tehran has been willing \nto endure increasing economic pressure in order to continue its nuclear \nprogram. The regime is unlikely to concede anything during negotiations \nif it does not believe that Washington will actually follow through on such \nthreats. Although specific public redlines are often unpalatable, the Obama \nadministration must clarify internally when it would take military steps, \nand these intentions must be made clear to the Iranians. \nIn the same vein, the military option requires a credible negotiating \ncomplement, as seen in the early 1990s with Iraq. To legitimize military \naction against Saddam Hussein's regime, Washington had to prove that all \nother options had been exhausted. Similarly, the only way to set the \npredicate for military action against Iran is to show the regime and the \ninternational community that everything has been tried, and that \nWashington has left Tehran with a way out. Failure to do so would \nundermine the legitimacy of any strikes. \nIt is also important to understand that curtailing Iran's nuclear progress \nwill not by itself alter the regime's regional agenda -- nuclear ambitions \nare but an extension of Tehran's wider aspirations toward hegemony in the \nMiddle East. Unfortunately, none of the longer-term proposals for \naddressing that issue seem feasible at the moment (e.g., regime change by \ninternal or external means; a shift in Tehran's views on the Supreme \nLeader and succession; a \"grand deal\" between Washington, Iran, and the \ninternational community). \nOne lesson to be learned from past interactions with Tehran (or lack \nthereof) is that when the United States proactively opposes Iranian \naggression in the Middle East, the regime relents, but when Washington \noffers a more passive response, Iranian aggression increases. With respect \nto Syria, for example, it cannot be assumed that Bashar al-Assad will fall \nat all, let alone quickly, without active U.S. engagement. If the Assad \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018204 \nregime does in fact survive, Iran would become increasingly emboldened, \nwith potentially disastrous consequences for the United States and its \nallies and interests in the Middle East. \nDenuding U.S. forces in the region to enable a pivot to Asia is also risky. \nNowhere else in the world is America more likely to deploy forces than in \nthe Persian Gulf in opposition to Iran, and nowhere else is it of utmost \nimportance that any potential confrontation be won decisively in the next \nfive to ten years than with the Islamic Republic. \nGoing forward, Washington must discriminate between Iranian behaviors \nit considers unacceptable -- such as support for terrorism, hegemonic \nambitions, and progress toward nuclear weapons -- and those it can \ntolerate. U.S. officials could open the door for negotiations by making \nclear to Tehran that they do not seek regime change; the first step in that \nregard would be to let Iran know that Washington respects it as a nation-\nstate and not a transnational revolutionary movement. \nFinally, disorganization within the U.S. government and a \"go it alone\" \nmentality have accounted for many of Washington's internal difficulties in \nresponding to the Iranian challenge. To alleviate this problem, all cabinet-\nlevel officials must be in constant and complete coordination, devoid of \nroutine bureaucratic obstacles. In addition, the appointment of a senior \nsubcabinet official whose sole responsibility is Iran (or, alternatively, a \nsmall group of officials in constant coordination) could allow the \nadministration to reorganize bureaucratically in preparation for this year of \ndecision. \nTHOMAS PICKERING \nDiscussions of containment policy typically imply accepting the Islamic \nRepublic as an inevitable nuclear power and using deterrence to deal with \na nuclear-armed Iran. Yet such an outcome would be disastrous for U.S. \nnonproliferation policy, which is based on the notion that fewer nuclear \nstates means less chance of miscalculated use. If Iran attains a nuclear \nweapon, other regional powers would likely follow suit -- clearly an \nundesirable outcome for the international community. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018205 \nAt the other end of the spectrum, using military means in the short term to \nguarantee prevention would entail a vast use of force -- essentially an \nunofficial, semipermanent occupation of Iran. This is not a viable path, \nparticularly since other diplomatic possibilities have not yet been \nexhausted. \nSimilarly, sanctions, while effective, are not sufficient by themselves. \nThey must be intertwined with negotiations -- as Washington and its allies \nincrease the pressure, cohesive and meaningful talks with equivalent \nconcessions should follow suit. Some have argued that negotiations should \nexpand to a \"big for big\" format, but decades of mistrust between the \nUnited States and Iran make smaller deals more practical. Such an \napproach would have to focus on ending Iran's most problematic \nenrichment activity: processing uranium to the 20 percent threshold, which \nmakes the leap to weapons-grade material much easier. Instead, the regime \ncould limit itself to 5 percent enrichment, and under strict supervision by \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency. \nThe intelligence community widely believes that although Iran has not yet \ndecided to make a nuclear weapon, it is still moving to acquire all the \nnecessary capabilities in case it chooses that path. Accordingly, \nWashington will need to obtain a concrete Iranian commitment to convert \nits stocks of readily upgradeable gaseous uranium into metallic fuel \nelements, which pose significantly less of a threat. A serious inspection \nsystem would need to be implemented in order to monitor these \nrequirements. In return, the Iranians would expect the lifting of nuclear-\nrelated sanctions. They would also likely ask for acknowledgement that \nthey have the right to continue their civil enrichment program, whether for \nsupposed use in cancer treatment or to safeguard against a potential \nRussian decision to cease fueling the Bushehr reactor. \nThus far, President Obama has been frustrated at the lack of progress in \nresponse to his openness toward the Iranian regime, and his new cabinet \nhas an obligation to help him solidify a negotiating position that improves \nthe situation. If the Iranians continue to reject U.S. positions that \nseemingly respond to some of their demands, then the administration \nshould begin applying other pressures. These steps should be taken sooner \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018206 \nrather than later so that the parties can move toward a mutually acceptable \nconclusion. \nWashington must also keep in mind that Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei \nhas the last word on all matters in Iran, and that negotiations will go only \nas far as he allows them to go. In years past, he issued a fatwa condemning \nnuclear weapons -- Washington could take advantage of this fact by \ndrafting a UN Security Council resolution endorsing the fatwa. This could \nbe a small step toward boosting Khamenei's international profile while \nsimultaneously pressuring Iran to follow its own religious decree. \nTo be sure, regime change remains an attractive alternative on paper, and \nsome in Washington view it as an insurance policy. Historically, however, \nregime change has not been a successful option for the United States, and \ninternal attempts at toppling Iran's leadership have thus far been crushed \nby Stalinesque suppression, including the 2009 uprising. Despite such \nfailures and Washington's limited influence in Iranian domestic affairs, \nU.S. policy should be to demonstratively support popular democratic \nmovements. \nArticle 4. \nTIME \nSpy Fail: Why Iran Is Losing Its Covert War  \nwith Israel  \nKarl Vick \nFeb. 13, 2013 -- Slumped in a Nairobi courtroom, suit coats rumpled and \nreading glasses dangling from librarian chains, the defendants made a poor \nshowing for the notorious Quds Force of the elite Iranian Revolutionary \nGuard Corps. Ahmad Abolafathi Mohammed and Sayed Mansour Mousa \nhad been caught red-handed and middle-aged. And if the latter did them a \ncertain credit — blandly forgettable always having been a good look for a \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018207 \nsecret agent — the prisoners still had to explain why they had hidden 15 \nkg of the military explosive RDX under bushes on a Mombasa golf \ncourse. \nCreated to advance Iran's interests clandestinely overseas, the Quds Force \nhas lately provided mostly embarrassment, stumbling in Azerbaijan, \nGeorgia, India, Kenya and most spectacularly in Thailand, where before \naccidentally blowing up their Bangkok safe house, Iran's secret agents  \nwere photographed in the sex-tourism mecca of Pattaya, one arm around a \nhookah, the other around a hooker. In its ongoing shadow war with Israel, \nthe Iranian side's lone \"success\" was the July 18 bombing of a Bulgarian \nbus carrying Israeli tourists — though European investigators last week \nofficially attributed that attack to Iran's Lebanese proxy, Hizballah. That \nleaves the Islamic Republic itself with a failure rate hovering near 100% \nabroad and an operational tempo — nine overseas plots uncovered in nine \nmonths — that carries a whiff of desperation. A Tehran government long \nbranded by U.S. officials as the globe's leading exporter of terrorism may \nbe cornering the market on haplessness. \nWithin Iran's own borders, however, the story is different. Twice in the \npast two years Iranian intelligence has cracked espionage rings working \nwith Israel's Mossad, Western intelligence officials tell TIME. In both \ncases, the arrests were the furthest thing from secret: announced at a news \nconference, each was later followed up by televised confessions broadcast \non Iranian state television in prime time. Given Iran's history of trumped-\nup confessions, skepticism is more than justified. But the arrests appear to \nbe solid. One intelligence official said the captured Iranians provided \n\"support and logistics\" to the Mossad operatives who carried out the \nassassinations of Iranian nuclear scientists. \nAt least four scientists were killed on Tehran's streets from 2010 to 2012, \nwhen, as TIME has reported, Israel ratcheted back on covert operations \ninside Iran. Officially, Israel has remained silent on the killings, though \ngovernment officials will coyly say they welcome the deaths. The Jewish \nstate maintains the same ambiguous posture on other \"setbacks\" to Iran's \nnuclear program widely — and correctly, Western intelligence officials \nsay — attributed to Mossad, from the Stuxnet computer virus, to \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018208 \nmysterious explosions like the massive blast at a missile base, which \ndestroyed ballistic missiles that could reach Israel. \nThe covert onslaught dovetails with Israel's history of reaching \"over the \nhorizon\" to disarm perceived threats at a distance. To keep advanced arms \nfrom reaching Hamas and Hizballah, Israel in the past year sent warplanes \nto bomb convoys and arms depots in Sudan and Syria, respectively, \nwithout apparent retribution. In the case of Iran, however, experts say the \naudacity of Israel's covert campaign stirred Tehran to revive an espionage \neffort that lay largely fallow since 9/11. The Spy vs. Spy contest that \nensued would prove woefully one-sided, even in the third-world countries \nwhere Iran chose to strike, hoping to avoid heightened security awareness \nin the developed world. In the end, its only success came inside Iran, \nwhere the secret police operate without inhibition. \nThe shadow war may have started on Jan. 15, 2007, the day Ardeshir \nHosseinpour passed away. Hosseinpour was a specialist in \nelectromagnetics at the Nuclear Technology Center in the city of Isfahan, \nIran, but his death might have escaped notice had Iran's government not \nkept it under wraps for almost a week, finally attributing it to fumes from \na faulty heater. An online report by the American private intelligence firm \nStratfor suggested another cause — radioactive poisoning — and hinted \nthat Mossad's Caesarea section was back in business. Caesarea, named for \nan Israeli beach town that dates back to Roman times, is the operations \nbranch of Israel's secret service, most notoriously responsible for the \nassassinations of some two dozen Palestinians (and an innocent waiter) \nafter the 1972 Munich Olympics. Assassinations are carried out by a very \nsmall unit dubbed Kidon, the Hebrew word for \"tip of the spear.\" Kidon \noperates at a remove from the legions of Mossad employees working in \nless lethal fields. \nIt would have been a unit called Hatzomet, or \"The Junction,\" that \nrecruited Majid Fashi, a handsome young Iranian who dropped out of high \nschool to pursue a career in kickboxing. By the account he gave on Iranian \nstate television early in 2011, Fashi presented himself at the Israeli \nconsulate in Istanbul in 2007 and was vetted for a solid year before being \nshown any trust. Two years later, on Jan. 12, 2010, he would place a bomb \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018209 \non a motorbike parked on the sidewalk outside the Tehran home of \nMasoud Alimohammadi, the nuclear physicist was killed when it was \ndetonated by remote control. \nIn the broadcast, Fashi accurately described the Mossad campus north of \nTel Aviv. He said he had been given a laptop equipped with a second \noperating system and used it to communicate through online drop boxes. \nHe was impressed by his handlers' thoroughness. At one point Fashi \ndescribed studying a scale model of Alimohammadi's street. \"It was an \nexact copy of the real one,\" Fashi said. \"The tree next it, the street curb, \nthe bridge.\" In a later broadcast, he was seated across from \nAlimohammadi's widow, who glared at him as he bowed his head and \nwept. Mossad officials were \"pissed off and shocked\" seeing their agent \non television, the intelligence official said. \nFashi was executed in May 2012. About the same time, Iran's intelligence \nminister announced the arrest of 14 more Iranians, eight men and six \nwomen dubbed members of the \"Terror Club\" in the subsequent  prime-\ntime broadcast of that name. Filmed in shadow, and rich in atmospherics, \nthe Aug. 5 program recreated Alimohammadi's death and four subsequent \nattacks: they started with the Nov. 29, 2010 nearly simultaneous attempts \non Majid Shariari and Fereydoun Abbasi, nuclear scientists driving to \nwork when magnetic \"sticky bombs\" were attached to the side of their cars \nfrom passing motorcycles. Abbasi managed to escape before it detonated, \nsaving his wife as well. Shariari was killed — a significant setback for the \nIranian nuclear program where he was the top scientist, according to a \nWestern intelligence official. \nThe confessed agents offered absorbing detail — they were aboard a Bajaj \nPulsar, wearing helmets, when the magnet bomb stuck on the right front \npanel of Shariari's car exploded. The riders scrambled into the \"trail car\" \nassigned to follow the target and disappeared into the traffic of the Imam \nAli Autobahn. Already gone was the car assigned to cut off and slow the \ncar carrying the scientist. They claimed to have rehearsed on a practice \ntrack inside Israel. None of the details could be confirmed, but an \nintelligence official acknowledged: \"Another network was taken.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018210 \nThe third scientist, Dariush Rezaeinejad was shot on July 23, 2011 after \npicking up his child at a day care; his wife described hearing shots whiz by \nas she chased the assailants. The most recent assassination was the Jan. 11, \n2012 death of Mustafa Ahmadi-Roshan, an expert on uranium enrichment, \nalso by a magnet bomb slapped on his car during his morning commute. \nBy then, Iran was trying to strike back. The task of avenging the scientists \nfell to the sprawling Quds Force's own covert-operations division, known \nas Unit 400. It took a shotgun approach, targeting Israeli diplomatic \nmissions in a variety of countries, mostly in the developing world where \nthe global antiterrorism mesh is not so fine. Exposed in Baku, Tbilisi, \nJohannesburg, Mombasa and Bangkok, the failures mounted at a pace that \nwas itself one of the problems. In the world of espionage, a quality covert \noperation can take years to pull together. Yet in the 15 months from May \n2011 to July 2012, the Quds Force and Hizballah attempted 20 attacks, by \nthe count of Matthew Levitt, a former State Department counterterrorism \nofficial. \"Hizballah and the Quds Force traded speed for tradecraft and \nreaped what they sowed,\" Levitt writes in a January report for the \nWashington Institute for Near East Policy. \"Quds Force planners were \nstretched thin by the rapid tempo of their new attack plan, and were forced \nto throw together random teams of operatives who had not trained \ntogether.\" \nThe decline in quality was so striking it initially inspired disbelief Recall \nthe preposterous-sounding plot weaving together a former used-car \nsalesman, Mexico's Zetas drug gang and a bank transfer from a \nRevolutionary Guard account to assassinate Saudi Arabia's ambassador — \nby bombing a Washington restaurant? A year on it looks like the new \nnormal. In Bangkok last month, an Iranian agent entered a courtroom in a \nwheelchair, having accidentally blown his legs off while fleeing police. A \nJanuary alert issued by Turkish intelligence was light on specifics but \nquite certain the Quds operatives would be staying in five-star hotels. \n\"There's a number of reasons that Iranian intelligence has suffered,\" says \nMeir Javedanfar, an Iranian-born analyst who lectures at the \nInterdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, Israel. \"No. 1,\" he says, \"is the 2009 \nuprisings in Iran.\" The street protests over a fraudulent election \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018211 \nundermined the perceived legitimacy of the state among people who once \nwould work for it, including in its secret services. \"People less and less see \nit as a nationalist endeavor and more as a Khamenei-related project to \nstrengthen himself,\" Javedanfar says, referring to Iran's Supreme Leader \nAyatullah Ali Khamenei, who by some published accounts personally \nauthorizes all overseas attacks. \nHard-liners further aggravated the situation by purging competent \nreformists from both the secret services and from Iran's embassies — \ncrucial to a force expected to work undetected abroad. \"Basically the Quds \nForce doesn't cooperate with the Foreign Ministry, and the Foreign \nMinistry isn't what it used to be either,\" says Javedanfar. Under President \nMahmoud Ahmadinejad, 42% of ministry employees have only high \nschool degrees. \"The regime is a bigger threat to itself than Israel,\" he \nsays. \nKarl Vick has been TIME's Jerusalem bureau chief since 2010, covering \nIsrael, the Palestine territories and nearby sovereignties.

In his \n2003 Yale University address on \"Global Challenges,\" he said: \nIf you believe that maintaining power and control and absolute freedom of \nmovement and sovereignty is important to your country's future, there's \nnothing inconsistent in that [the US continuing to behaving unilaterally]. \n[The US is] the biggest, most powerful country in the world now. . . . But \nif you believe that we should be trying to create a world with rules and \npartnerships and habits of behavior that we would like to live in when \nwe're no longer the military political economic superpower in the world, \nthen you wouldn't do that. It just depends on what you believe. \nLong before 2003, Clinton wanted to begin preparing Americans for this \nnew world. \"Clinton believed [...] what we had in the wake of the cold \nwar was a multilateral moment — an opportunity to shape the world \nthrough our active leadership of the institutions Clinton admired and \n[Charles] Krauthammer disdained,\" writes Strobe Talbott, former deputy \nsecretary of state in his book The Great Experiment: The Story of Ancient \nEmpires, Modern States, and the Quest for a Global Nation. \"But Clinton \nkept that belief largely to himself while he was in office.... political \ninstincts told him it would be inviting trouble to suggest that the sun \nwould someday set on American preeminence.\" Sadly, few Americans \nhave heeded Clinton's wisdom. Few dare to mention that America could \nwell be number two. I discovered this when I chaired a panel on \"the \nfuture of American power\" at the 2012 World Economic Forum in Davos. \nAfter citing projections that America would have the second largest \neconomy in just a few years, I asked the American panelists — two \nsenators, a congresswoman and a former deputy national security advisor \n— whether Americans are ready to become number two. To my shock, \nnone could acknowledge publically this possibility. \nAmerica may well become number two faster than anyone has anticipated. \nAccording to the most recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) \nprojections, China will have larger share of global GDP than the United \nStates by 2017. In 1980, in PPP terms, the US share of the global economy \nwas 25 percent, while China's was 2.2 percent. By 2017, the US share will \ndecline to 17.9 percent, and China's will rise to 18.3 percent. Even if \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018213 \nAmerica becomes number two, we will still have a better world. In many \nways, the world is \"converging\" to American values and standards, as I \nexplain in The Great Convergence. The global middle class is booming, \ninterstate war is waning, and never before have people traveled and \ncommunicated across the world so easily. These changes are creating \ncommon values and norms across the world. Education and scientific \nreasoning, for example, are enabling people the world over to speak with a \ncommon language. However, while humanity is well on its way to \ncombating absolute poverty and interstate warfare, other problems are \nsurfacing. Preventing and curtailing transnational issues like climate \nchange, human and drug trafficking, and financial crises require \ncooperation among nation states, yet this is not happening. A simple \nanalogy illustrates this. Before the era of modern globalization, \nhumankind was like a flotilla of more than 100 separate boats in their \nseparate countries. The world needed a set of rules then to ensure that the \nmany boats did not collide and facilitate their cooperation on the high seas \nif they chose to do so. The 1945 rules-based order strived to do this, and \ndespite some obvious failures, it succeeded in producing a relatively stable \nglobal order for more than 50 years. Today, the 7 billion people who \ninhabit planet earth no longer live in more than 100 separate boats. \nInstead, they live in 193 separate cabins on the same boat. But this boat \nhas a problem. It has 193 captains and crews, each claiming exclusive \nresponsibility for one cabin. No captain or crew cares for the boat as a \nwhole. The world is now sailing into increasingly turbulent waters with no \ncaptain or crew at the helm. The Great Convergence echoes the themes \nof Clinton's 2003 Yale speech. It's in the interest of all — particularly great \npowers — to strengthen institutions of global governance so that we're not \nsailing blindly into choppy waters without a captain. The National \nIntelligence Council recently projected that in 2030 Asia would overtake \nthe Western world economically, technologically and militarily. When \nChina becomes a world superpower in a matter of decades, the United \nStates and Europe will want to ensure that China plays by the rules. \nBut in order to make international organizations like the United Nations, \nthe IMF and the World Bank more credible and effective, they must \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018214 \nundergo serious reform. It is manifestly absurd that the West makes up 12 \npercent of the world's population but takes up 60 percent of UN Security \nCouncil permanent seats. It's nonsensical that the head of the IMF is \nalways a European and the head of the World Bank is always an American \nas the West's share of global GDP diminishes every year. This \nconcentration of clout in the hands of a relative few has grave implications \nfor these institutions' effectiveness and independence, making them \ninstruments of the West. No other organization, not even huge global \nNGOs like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or the Clinton \nFoundation, has the scope and legitimacy that the UN currently enjoys. \nFor example, the United States for years has been trying to pressure China \nto take a more proactive role in fighting climate change. Predictably, \nChina has resisted these pressures because they saw them as a clever yet \ntransparent American ruse to curtail Chinese economic growth. Only when \nthe United Nations Development Programme raised the issue with China \ndid the Chinese government take heed, as the UNDP is seen as a neutral \nparty in China. The UN and its many agencies may soon lose invaluable \ncredibility if the West insists on monopolizing its power over these \ninstitutions. \nAny reform of the UN should take into account three principles: \ndemocracy, recognition of power balances and the rule of law. Institutions \nof global governance can be made more democratic by ensuring that their \nleadership accurately reflects the composition of world's population. At \nthe same time, we must also take into account geopolitical relationships \namong emerging and middle powers. Finally, the rule of law is essential to \nthe mediation and resolution of thorny international issues and to \ngoverning the conduct of states on the international stage so as to prevent \nescalation of conflict. \nIn this rapidly changing world, it's a mistake to allow institutions of global \ngovernance to stay as they are. The 1945 rules-based order is no longer \nappropriate for 21st century circumstances. Global leaders must better \nprepare us for the challenges to come and equip our international \norganizations to deal with them. Leaders must find the courage to continue \nadvocating for stronger multilateral cooperation. It is time for our captains \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018215 \nand crews to emerge from their cabins and start steering the boat. \nKishore Mahbubani is dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, \nNUS, and author of the forthcoming book The Great Convergence: Asia, \nthe West, and the Logic of One World. \nArticle 6. \nForeign affairs \nPyongyang's Nuclear Logic  \nJennifer Lind, Keir A. Lieber, and Daryl G. Press \nFebruary 14, 2013 -- In his State of the Union address, U.S. President \nBarack Obama described North Korea's recent nuclear test as a \nprovocation that required a firm response. The intended audience for that \nprovocation, though, is up for debate. Some commentators have posited \nthat the test was a signal aimed at China, designed to demonstrate North \nKorea's independence from its great-power patron. Others think that Kim \nJong-un was sending a message to the newly elected president of South \nKorea, Park Geun-hye. Still other North Korea experts have suggested that \nthe test was actually meant for domestic consumption, to lift the sagging \nmorale of a deprived public or for the regime to curry favor with the \nmilitary. The intended North Korean signal is being analyzed and debated \nby U.S. government officials, who hold views across the spectrum. \nA much simpler explanation exists. Pyongyang tested a nuclear device for \nthe same reason it has been testing long-range missile designs: to see what \nworks. In truth, the effort was less a signal than an attempt to master the \ntechnical capabilities that are vital to its nuclear deterrent. \nThis rationale should come as no surprise to those steeped in Cold War \nhistory. Between 1945 and 1992, the United States conducted 1,054 \nnuclear tests and fired an untold number of missiles. If the goal had merely \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018216 \nbeen to show the Soviets that the United States meant business, testing \nnearly twice a month throughout the entire Cold War would have been \noverkill. In fact, Operation Sandstone -- a series of three tests at Enewetak \nAtoll in 1948 -- was not intended to warn off the Soviets as tensions rose \nover Berlin. Nor was the series of 48 underground tests launched in the \nsummer of 1964 designed to impress the newly installed premier, Leonid \nBrezhnev. And the United States would not have conducted a dozen \natomic blasts at its Nevada test site in the first half of 1977 -- including the \nCove, Dofino, Marsilly, Bulkhead, Crewline, Forefoot, Carnelian, Strake, \nFlotost, Gruyere, Scantling, and Scupper detonations -- just because new \nPresident Jimmy Carter was vulnerable to right-wing criticism. \nThe United States did what it did because it needed its ultimate deterrent \nto actually work, and because the technical requirements of the nuclear \nmission continually changed. The ruins of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were \nevidence enough that the United States could destroy cities, but deterring \nthe Soviet Union was a far greater challenge. If the Soviets had invaded \nWestern Europe, for example, U.S. bombers would have had to penetrate \nalerted Soviet air defenses, identify Soviet ground forces and industrial \ncenters, and attack them. Accordingly, U.S. bombers had to be highly \nmaneuverable and able to carry multiple weapons, so the bombs \nthemselves had to be lighter and smaller than the ones the United States \nused against Japan. The Soviets put another wrinkle in Washington's plans \nwhen they began to deploy large numbers of their own nuclear weapons. \nThe United States needed to find a way to potentially destroy the Soviet \narsenal on the ground. Eliminating those targets -- numerous and often \nhardened -- required even greater numbers of bombs, even lighter designs, \nand more accurate delivery systems. So the United States updated its \ndesigns and tested. And tested. And tested again. \nLike the United States during the Cold War, North Korea has apparently \ndecided that nuclear weapons are central to its national security strategy. \nWith few friends, its conventional military forces outgunned, an economy \nin tatters, and facing off against a superpower prone to deposing \ndictatorships across the globe, the Kim regime set about building an \noperational nuclear arsenal. And just as NATO planned to thwart a Soviet \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018217 \ninvasion by striking targets in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, North \nKorea presumably plans to defend itself, should war erupt on the \npeninsula, by threatening U.S. regional allies and targets in the United \nStates. \nNorth Korea's mission requires small, lightweight warheads, and missiles \nthat work -- and the only way to know that they work is to test them. So \nfar, the weapons have proved unspectacular. The country's first nuclear \ntest, conducted in 2006, was an embarrassment. Pyongyang had told the \nChinese that the device would generate four kilotons of explosive power, \nbut it ended up producing less than one. The second test in 2009 fared \nslightly better, producing between one and eight kilotons, although it is \nnot known what size of a blast the North Koreans had sought. Moreover, \nPyongyang has much more work to do before it can boast weapons that \nwill actually fit on its missiles (which have been, themselves, a series of \nhumiliating failures). \nObservers in the West who presume that North Korea's behavior must be \nabout signaling should remember NATO and the United States' own \nexperience during the Cold War. The United States understood then that \nthe ability to conduct nuclear operations was the very foundation of a \ncredible deterrence strategy. Today, a sound strategy for dealing with \nNorth Korea should not ascribe ulterior motives to acts that the United \nStates once considered rational and routine. \nThe view that nuclear weapons are merely political instruments -- suitable \nfor sending signals, but not waging wars -- is now so common in \nWashington, London, and Berlin that it is hard to find anyone who \ndisagrees. Yet those comforting assumptions are not shared by leaders \neverywhere. Beyond North Korea, Russia is cutting down its arsenal, \nmodernizing the nuclear forces it plans to keep, and increasing its reliance \non nuclear weapons in national defense strategy. China is slowly \nexpanding its own arsenal, while substantially improving its weapons. \nAnd Iran seems so committed to going nuclear that it has been ready to \nendure crippling sanctions and risk foreign attack. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018218 \nIt is unfortunate that U.S. policymakers are so convinced of nuclear \nobsolescence that they have difficulty understanding the motivations of \npotential adversaries. It would be tragic, however, if their questionable \nassumptions prevent them from recognizing the deterrence problems that \nlie ahead and the grave difficulties that will be posed by adversaries, such \nas North Korea, that still cling to nuclear weapons. \nJENNIFER LIND is an Associate Professor of government at Dartmouth \nCollege and the author of Sorry States: Apologies in International \nPolitics.

Over the past few years, there have been numerous profiles in \nnewspapers and profiles in magazines attempting to document the two \nmen who are supposed to make the effort—Israeli Prime Minister \nBenjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud \nAbbas. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018219 \nDelving into the lives and minds of world leaders is an undoubtedly \nhelpful, exciting, and informative way to find answers, but a conflict as \nmultifaceted and complicated as the Israeli-Palestinian dispute cannot be \nfully explained without taking into account the opinions of the ordinary \npeople who live the reality every single day. Millions of Israelis and \nPalestinians on both sides of the green line have had their voices drowned \nout by the very politicians, lawmakers, and personalities who purport to \nrepresent them. \nThe result is a host of unanswered questions. What does the average \nIsraeli or Palestinian think about the chances for a lasting and \ncomprehensive peace agreement? What types of concessions need to be \ngiven for a deal to be struck? Do Israelis have the political courage to \nsacrifice on settlements and Jerusalem so the conflict can finally be \nresolved? Can the Palestinians negotiate in good faith? \nLuckily, polling organizations in Israel and Palestine have spent years \ntrying to answer these very questions, often working together and sharing \ntheir resources during the hunt. \nTwo of the latest polls, one from the Jerusalem Media and \nCommunications Center (JMCC) and the other from the Palestinian Center \nfor Policy and Survey Research (PCPSR), are particularly telling. Unlike \nother surveys that confirm what most in the international community \nalready think, the results of these polls are unprecedented, revealing a \nstark and disturbing malaise in the Palestinian territories. \nThe message is clear: frustration with the conflict is at a high point, the \ntwo-state solution is steadily losing credibility in the eyes of the people, \nand ordinary citizens in the Holy Land are starting to wonder whether a \nsettlement can be achieved without another round of bloodshed. \nOslo Fatigue \nWhen asked by the PSPSR whether Mahmoud Abbas's policy of peace \ntalks or armed resistance by Hamas is the best way to achieve a \nPalestinian state, an alarming 60 percent of Palestinians surveyed threw in \ntheir lot with armed resistance (compared to 28 percent who favored \nnegotiations). With the eight-day Israel-Hamas war having ended with a \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018220 \nceasefire that many view as a victory for the Islamist group, Hamas Prime \nMinister Ismail Haniyeh finds his popularity having soared. Forty-eight \npercent of Palestinians say that they would rather pick Haniyeh as \nPalestine's next president instead of Abbas, who has struggled to secure \nthe freedom of movement and self-determination that so many \nPalestinians once expected from his government. \nThe JMCC issued similar findings. By far the most disturbing figure in the \npoll is the exponential rise in support among the Palestinian public for \narmed operations against Israel-50.9 percent now view attacking Israeli \npositions in the current climate as a credible way to express their \ngrievances and pressure the Israeli government to compromise. This is a \n20-percent increase from the previous year. \nThe numbers can perhaps best be summarized by Ali Najjar, an 18-year-\nold Palestinian who lives in a refugee camp. \"In my view,\" he said, \"what \nwas taken by force will only be returned by force. Twenty years after \nOslo, we haven't gained one inch of Palestine.\" \nMany young Palestinians agree. Indeed, the words summarize the how \ndire the situation has become for an entire generation of Palestinians, most \nof whom are too young to remember the signing of the Oslo Accords in \n1993. Most have not seen any benefit from peace agreements or \nnegotiations, and all of them have grown tired of the settlement \nconstruction in the West Bank, the killing of Palestinian civilians, and the \ninternal fighting among Palestinian politicians that never seems to \ndissipate. \nThe Corrosive Status Quo \nOne cannot blame Palestinian civilians for feeling this way. The previous \nyear was a terrible one for Abbas and his government. Settlement tenders \nand approvals in the West Bank rose to such an extent that the anti-\nsettlement organization Peace Now named 2012 \"the year of the  \nsettlement,\" with the Ministry of Defense authorizing an additional 6,000 \nhousing units and Netanyahu pushing for the construction of 11,000  \nhomes in the month of December alone. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018221 \nThe lack of economic support from donor nations and the restrictions that \nimpede the Palestinian economy from functioning at anywhere near its full \npotential have also made for a deadly cocktail for Abbas' Palestinian \nAuthority. Combined with the occasional holding of Palestinian tax \nrevenue by the Israelis, the PA is finding it incredibly difficult to pay the \ntens of thousands of employees on its payroll. \nThe recent Israeli parliamentary elections perhaps best illustrate where the \nPalestinian issue is today: at the bottom of the barrel. Israeli politicians \nchose to focus their campaigning on social and economic issues, from the \nprice of housing and cost of living to whether religious students should be \ndrafted into the Israeli military like everyone else. The only Israeli \ncandidate who spoke about the need to reengage the Palestinians in peace \ntalks was the former foreign minister Tzipi Livni, whose party failed to \nreach double-digits in the incoming parliament. \nThe overall message is depressingly familiar to Palestinians: creating a \nPalestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem is \nsimply not on the list of priorities for Israel at the current time. And the \nPalestinian Authority is proving itself to be an increasingly fragile \ngoverning body without the constant generosity of foreign countries; it's \nan institution that cannot adequately care for its people, let alone its \nemployees who go months without pay. The average Palestinian is losing \nhope that peace is possible in his or her lifetime. Palestinian leaders may \nspeak of ending the occupation, but for those who live under it, the \noccupation is so ingrained that escaping it has become a violation of the \nnormal. \nSome may take the more militant attitudes of Palestinians as confirmation \nthat Israel does not have a partner for peace. Yet those attitudes can also \nbe viewed differently: without a renewed effort at peacemaking, however \nfrustrating and difficult it will be, the conflict will reach a nadir where \nsearching for a peace partner will be irrelevant. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 018222 \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

    "email_text": "From: Lisa New \nSent: 12/19/2016 4:36:41 AM \nTo: Jeffrey Epstein [jeeyacation@gmail.com] \nCC: Leah Reis-Dennis [ \nSubject: Thank You from Lisa and Poetry in America \nImportance: High \nDear \nJeffrey \n(and please see note at bottom), \nThis end-of-the-year letter is to catch you up on developments and to report progress made in 2016 \nby Poetry in America, by its associated non-profit production company, Verse Video Education, and \nby (and with) our new Harvard partner, the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning. Whether \nyou are a longstanding adviser and supporter of Poetry in America, or you've more recently joined our \ncircle of proponents, your contributions, thought partnership and enthusiasm have made this year's \nsuccesses possible. \nLast fall, I knew this would be a crucial year. Goals for 2016 included moving our co-produced \ntelevision series, Poetry in America, toward a concrete release date (now entering post-production, \nwe launch nationwide in April 2018), converting our six HarvardX MOOC modules into for-credit \ncourses (now complete and being offered by Harvard's Division of Continuing Education), and getting \nthe word out on our first course developed especially for K-12 educators, Poetry in America for \nTeachers: The City from Whitman to Hip Hop. With a mission of creating and distributing the highest-\nquality humanities content for a wide variety of learners, our projects now rely on a salaried \nproduction staff of five, a rotating corps of part timers and contractors, and a growing cohort of \nHarvard graduate students, undergraduates and interns whom we train in the public-facing \nhumanities. Growing fast, in 2016 we more firmly established Verse Video Education as a nimble and \nstable producer of humanities-based content (now including an archive of over 120 separate \ninterviews with distinguished discussants), while also defining a forward-looking partnership and \ngrowth strategy with Harvard. As 2016 draws to a close, I have much progress to report. \nVerse Video Education: Independent 501c3 \nIn April 2016, Verse Video Education, the fledgling production company I'd founded in 2014, received \nIRS approval and became a 501c3. Now capable of accepting philanthropic contributions, Verse \nVideo Education has also begun to generate revenue by producing high-quality educational media for \nother institutions. Clients within our first year included Greenwich Country Day School, YIVO Institute \nfor Jewish Research, Schlesinger Library, Harvard Institute for Global Health, and Project Zero. While \nphilanthropic donations remain essential, work for clients allows us to amplify the impact of \nphilanthropic donations, not only permitting additional investment in our flagship partnerships with \nWGBH and Harvard, but also fostering development of new partnerships and projects. These include \na video series on poetry and science now running with award-winning magazine Nautilus, a \ncollaboration with distinguished poet Robert Pinsky and his Favorite Poem Project, and an expansion \nof our poetry film series with partners at The Nantucket Project. Advised by a stellar and diversely \ntalented board, Verse Video Education is looking toward sustainability. We are now discussing \ndistribution of new content with a variety of stakeholders, including media providers in China. \nNew Harvard Partner: Bok Center for Teaching and Learning \nMeanwhile, Poetry in America has deepened its partnership and formulated a plan for growth going \nforward at Harvard. This fall, Harvard's Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Mike Smith, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019203 \nendorsed the integration and expansion of my public-facing humanities work within the Derek Bok \nCenter for Teaching and Learning. As a Bok Fellow this year, and alongside Bok director Rob Lue in \nthe years to come, I will be working to substantially expand Bok's capacity and resources to train \nhumanists in 21st-century methods of public engagement-- developing courses, digital fellowship \nopportunities and also securing distribution outlets and partners for content produced in Bok by \nHarvard humanists. By next year at this time, I will be turning some of my attention beyond poetry (my \nfavorite, but hardly the only humanistic mode of communication!) to create a wider base of \nhumanities materials for use in American schools and other institutions. We will begin integrating and \nanchoring Poetry in America content (on art, sport and play; on the environment; and on health and \nwell being) with content created by others. As I continue to experiment with use of digital media \nwithin my residential courses for undergraduates and graduates, I shall also be working with other \nfaculty and graduate students. My work at Bok will also facilitate collaborations between humanists \nworking across the whole university. Projects for 2017 include work with HarvardX on drama and \nShakespeare, with Harvard's Center for the Environment, with the Arts and Humanities Initiative at \nHarvard Medical School, and with several programs within Harvard's Graduate School of Education. \nLaunching in 2017: Our First Course Designed Specifically for Teachers \nVerse Video Education has allocated much of its staff time this year to bringing its first course \ndesigned specifically to support the American secondary classroom to completion. Poetry in America \nfor Teachers: The City from Whitman to Hip Hop draws on assets created at HarvardX, along with \nfootage captured with our TV partners and independently by Verse Video Education. The resulting \ncourse, designed for English, Social Studies, and Arts teachers, as well as for librarians, \nadministrators and others, provides deep content instruction as well as pedagogical training. \nCommon Core aligned, this course, the first of its kind, is now open for enrollment, and will launch \nJanuary 23rd. We are currently discussing group enrollments with major educational systems and \nreformers across the nation, and we are also raising scholarship funds for strapped enrollees. Over \ntime, we hope to play a leading role in improving literacy and in strengthening the humanities across \nthe American educational landscape. \nAiring Nationwide in 2018: Poetry in America, The Television Series \nIn May 2016, Verse Video Education was asked by WGBH and American Public Television to expand \nits television series in development from 8 to 13 episodes, listed below. \nThe following episodes are entering post-production: \nOn Edward Hirsch's \"Fast Break\": Shaquille O'Neal, Pau Gasol, Shane Battier, Edward Hirsch, \nand an on-court pick-up basketball chorus filmed at Success Academy Charter School; On W.H. \nAuden's \"Musee Des Beaux Arts\": Ambassador Samantha Power, David Brooks, Peter Sacks; On \nRobert Hayden's \"Those Winter Sundays\": Vice President Joe Biden, Elizabeth Alexander, Angela \nDuckworth, Kevin Young, and a chorus of fathers and sons; On Carl Sandburg's \"Skyscraper\": \nFrank Gehry, Robert Polito, and a chorus of Young Student Poets; On Nas's \"New York State of \nMind\": Nas, Russell Simmons, Salamishah Tillet, Steve Stoute, and a chorus of hip hop heads; On \nGalway Kinnell's \"The Grey Heron\": E.O. Wilson, Robert Hass, Laura McPhee; On Gwendolyn \nBrooks's \"To Prisoners\": Anna Deveare Smith, Reginald Dwayne Betts, Li-Young Lee and a \nchorus of exonerees from the Innocence Project; On William Carlos Williams's \"This Is Just To \nSay\": Woody Allen, Jane Hirshfield, Rafael Campo and a chorus of couples young and old; On \nLangston Hughes's \"Harlem\": President Bill Clinton, Herbie Hancock, Sonia Sanchez and a chorus \nof children from Promise Academy; On Allen Ginsberg's Hymmnn from \"Kaddish\" and \"Hum \nBom\": Bono, Juan Felipe Herrera and a chorus of clergy. \nThe production of the following episodes will wrap early 2017: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019204 \nOn Emily Dickinson's \"I cannot dance opon my Toes\": Cynthia Nixon, Yo Yo Ma, Marie Howe \nand Bill T. Jones; On Marianne Moore's \"The Fish\": Jorie Graham, Edward Norton, Conservation \nInternational scientists, and the passengers and crew of oceanographic vessel The Alucia; On \nElizabeth Bishop's \"One Art\" or Edna St. Vincent Millay's \"Four Sonnets.\" \nJeffrey, \nJust a quick note to thank you again for all the help you've given me. The generous contribution you \nmade last year to Verse Video Education is now in use (we've hired our new editor!). Once he helps \nus to plow through the work of this year, we'll begin to look forward to crafting educational content on \nthe literature of art, sport and play (these materials now including footage from recent shoots with \nShaquille O'Neal, Yo Yo Ma, Cynthia Nixon, Bono and others). 100K makes so much possible. \nBut, of course, you've also been a key preceptor as I've learned how --squirming all the way--the \nsausage really gets made in public television. I can't say I've been entirely successful in taming costs \nthere, but I've been far better armed and more mindful of what they should be after the stern tutorial \nyou administered. \nWhenever Templeton might be ready to evaluate another application, I'm ready for another proposal \nfor them. I wonder if you might arrange a meeting for me with the famous Bamaby? I can't yet afford a \ngrant writer, and so the time one of these suckers takes makes me think doing more advance \nreconnaissance is crucial. Would he meet with me? Kosher? I'd also love to meet with the Blacks as I \nget closer to making content on theatre. I hope that Debra is well. \nAnd heard there's another little Jeff in the caribbean... \nBest, \nElisa New \nPowell M. Cabot Professor of American Literature \nHarvard University \n148 Barker Center \n12 Quincy Street \nCambridge, MA \n02138 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019205 \n",

Objective: an alliance between \nright-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections \nNEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru who \nwas Donald Trump's right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following the racist \nviolence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the Daily Beast \nhimself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (II Movimento), right in the heart of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019312 \nEurope and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view of the \nEuropean elections which will be held in spring 2019. \nObjective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor of \nthe Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in support of \nNGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist right, accused \nof plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in order to have \nlabour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current Minister of the Interior \nMatteo Salvini. \nThe ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in the \nEuropean campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and \nRome — is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great \"populist international\" of which he \nhas long since been dreaming. \nThe Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic \nadvice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European \nmovements. Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling \nfunding. \nThe aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of \"super group\" that if victorious can conquer up to a \nthird of the European Parliament in the elections next May. \nIndeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The \nAmerican strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress \n— and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data stolen \nfrom Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump emerged victor. \nIt is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to West.

Objective: an alliance \nbetween right-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections \nNEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru \nwho was Donald Trump's right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following \nthe racist violence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the \nDaily Beast himself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (II Movimento), right in the \nheart of Europe and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view \nof the European elections which will be held in spring 2019. \nObjective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor \nof the Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in \nsupport of NGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist \nright, accused of plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in \norder to have labour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current \nMinister of the Interior Matteo Salvini. \nThe ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in \nthe European campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and \nRome — is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great \"populist international\" of which he \nhas long since been dreaming. \nThe Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic \nadvice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European \nmovements. Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling \nfunding. \nThe aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of \"super group\" that if victorious can conquer up to a \nthird of the European Parliament in the elections next May. \nIndeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The \nAmerican strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress \n— and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data \nstolen from Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump \nemerged victor. It is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019322 \nWest. And he has already met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine Le Pen and \nthe former leader of the British separatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on \nFriday in Pennsylvania, USA, to a fundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman Lou Barletta. \nWithout forgetting the Italians of Lega and 5 stars. Of them, he said: \"If it works in Italy, we can \nimport the model anywhere\". \nThe Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. \nIn short, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries \nsupporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But \nin the future the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe. Also \nbecause the relationships with Trump have worsened after the revelations he made to Michael Wolff \nand published in the scandal book \"Fire and Fury\". \"Better to reign in Hell than to serve in \nParadise,\" Bannon says now paraphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's Lost \nParadise. Hell in this case would be the dear old Europe and its democratic values. The \"army of \ndarkness\" is already among us. \nIn Sacratissimo Corde Iesu et Purissimo Corde Mariae et Castissimo Corde Ioseph. \n******* \nBenjamin Harnwell \nFounder and President of the Board of Trustees \nDignitatis Humanae Institute \nCell: \nOffice: \nIstituto Dignitatis Humanae \n44 Via delle Fornaci  \nRoma 00165  \nITALY  \n@ben harnwell \nwww.dignitatishumanae.com \nII giorno 22 lug 2018, alle ore 15:38, Steve Bannon < > ha scritto: \nWhat does this say??? \nBegin forwarded message: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019323 \nI From: Maria Luisa <_____________________ \nDate: July 22, 2018 at 9:11:58 AM EDT \nTo: Steve Bannon < >, Preate Alexandra < \n<PHOTO-2018-07-22-10-02-17.jpg> \nSent from my iPhone \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

He is at Institue for Advanced Studies. .. That being said, let me ask him if he can \nshepard you through Templeton \nOn Sun, Dec 18, 2016 at 11:36 PM, Lisa New <:=. \nDear \nJeffrey \n(and please see note at bottom), \nwrote: \nThis end-of-the-year letter is to catch you up on developments and to report progress made in 2016 \nby Poetry in America, by its associated non-profit production company, Verse Video Education, and \nby (and with) our new Harvard partner, the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning. Whether \nyou are a longstanding adviser and supporter of Poetry in America, or you've more recently joined \nour circle of proponents, your contributions, thought partnership and enthusiasm have made this \nyear's successes possible. \nLast fall, I knew this would be a crucial year. Goals for 2016 included moving our co-produced \ntelevision series, Poetry in America, toward a concrete release date (now entering post-production, \nwe launch nationwide in April 2018), converting our six HarvardX MOOC modules into for-credit \ncourses (now complete and being offered by Harvard's Division of Continuing Education), and \ngetting the word out on our first course developed especially for K-12 educators, Poetry in America  \nfor Teachers: The City from Whitman to Hip Hop. With a mission of creating and distributing the \nhighest-quality humanities content for a wide variety of learners, our projects now rely on a salaried \nproduction staff of five, a rotating corps of part timers and contractors, and a growing cohort of \nHarvard graduate students, undergraduates and interns whom we train in the public-facing \nhumanities. Growing fast, in 2016 we more firmly established Verse Video Education as a nimble \nand stable producer of humanities-based content (now including an archive of over 120 separate \ninterviews with distinguished discussants), while also defining a forward-looking partnership and \ngrowth strategy with Harvard. As 2016 draws to a close, I have much progress to report. \nVerse Video Education: Independent 501c3 \nIn April 2016, Verse Video Education, the fledgling production company I'd founded in 2014, \nreceived IRS approval and became a 501c3. Now capable of accepting philanthropic contributions, \nVerse Video Education has also begun to generate revenue by producing high-quality educational \nmedia for other institutions. Clients within our first year included Greenwich Country Day School, \nYIVO Institute for Jewish Research, Schlesinger Library, Harvard Institute for Global Health, and \nProject Zero. While philanthropic donations remain essential, work for clients allows us to amplify the \nimpact of philanthropic donations, not only permitting additional investment in our flagship \npartnerships with WGBH and Harvard, but also fostering development of new partnerships and \nprojects. These include a video series on poetry and science now running with award-winning \nmagazine Nautilus, a collaboration with distinguished poet Robert Pinsky and his Favorite Poem \nProject, and an expansion of our poetry film series with partners at The Nantucket Project. Advised \nby a stellar and diversely talented board, Verse Video Education is looking toward sustainability. We \nare now discussing distribution of new content with a variety of stakeholders, including media \nproviders in China. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019326 \nNew Harvard Partner: Bok Center for Teaching and Learning \nMeanwhile, Poetry in America has deepened its partnership and formulated a plan for growth going \nforward at Harvard. This fall, Harvard's Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Mike Smith, \nendorsed the integration and expansion of my public-facing humanities work within the Derek Bok \nCenter for Teaching and Learning. As a Bok Fellow this year, and alongside Bok director Rob Lue in \nthe years to come, I will be working to substantially expand Bok's capacity and resources to train \nhumanists in 21st-century methods of public engagement-- developing courses, digital fellowship \nopportunities and also securing distribution outlets and partners for content produced in Bok by \nHarvard humanists. By next year at this time, I will be turning some of my attention beyond poetry \n(my favorite, but hardly the only humanistic mode of communication!) to create a wider base of \nhumanities materials for use in American schools and other institutions. We will begin integrating and \nanchoring Poetry in America content (on art, sport and play; on the environment; and on health and \nwell being) with content created by others. As I continue to experiment with use of digital media \nwithin my residential courses for undergraduates and graduates, I shall also be working with other \nfaculty and graduate students. My work at Bok will also facilitate collaborations between humanists \nworking across the whole university. Projects for 2017 include work with HarvardX on drama and \nShakespeare, with Harvard's Center for the Environment, with the Arts and Humanities Initiative at \nHarvard Medical School, and with several programs within Harvard's Graduate School of Education. \nLaunching in 2017: Our First Course Designed Specifically for Teachers \nVerse Video Education has allocated much of its staff time this year to bringing its first course \ndesigned specifically to support the American secondary classroom to completion. Poetry in America \nfor Teachers: The City from Whitman to Hip Hop draws on assets created at HarvardX, along with \nfootage captured with our TV partners and independently by Verse Video Education. The resulting \ncourse, designed for English, Social Studies, and Arts teachers, as well as for librarians, \nadministrators and others, provides deep content instruction as well as pedagogical training. \nCommon Core aligned, this course, the first of its kind, is now open for enrollment, and will launch \nJanuary 23rd. We are currently discussing group enrollments with major educational systems and \nreformers across the nation, and we are also raising scholarship funds for strapped enrollees. Over \ntime, we hope to play a leading role in improving literacy and in strengthening the humanities across \nthe American educational landscape. \nAiring Nationwide in 2018: Poetry in America, The Television Series \nIn May 2016, Verse Video Education was asked by WGBH and American Public Television to \nexpand its television series in development from 8 to 13 episodes, listed below. \nThe following episodes are entering post-production: \nOn Edward Hirsch's \"Fast Break\": Shaquille O'Neal, Pau Gasol, Shane Battier, Edward Hirsch, \nand an on-court pick-up basketball chorus filmed at Success Academy Charter School; On W.H. \nAuden's \"Musee Des Beaux Arts\": Ambassador Samantha Power, David Brooks, Peter Sacks; On \nRobert Hayden's \"Those Winter Sundays\": Vice President Joe Biden, Elizabeth Alexander, \nAngela Duckworth, Kevin Young, and a chorus of fathers and sons; On Carl Sandburg's \n\"Skyscraper\": Frank Gehry, Robert Polito, and a chorus of Young Student Poets; On Nas's \"New \nYork State of Mind\": Nas, Russell Simmons, Salamishah Tillet, Steve Stoute, and a chorus of hip \nhop heads; On Galway Kinnell's \"The Grey Heron\": E.O. Wilson, Robert Hass, Laura McPhee; \nOn Gwendolyn Brooks's \"To Prisoners\": Anna Deveare Smith, Reginald Dwayne Betts, Li-Young \nLee and a chorus of exonerees from the Innocence Project; On William Carlos Williams's \"This Is \nJust To Say\": Woody Allen, Jane Hirshfield, Rafael Campo and a chorus of couples young and old; \nOn Langston Hughes's \"Harlem\": President Bill Clinton, Herbie Hancock, Sonia Sanchez and a \nchorus of children from Promise Academy; On Allen Ginsberg's Hymmnn from \"Kaddish\" and \n\"Hum Bom\": Bono, Juan Felipe Herrera and a chorus of clergy. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019327 \nThe production of the following episodes will wrap early 2017: \nOn Emily Dickinson's \"I cannot dance opon my Toes\": Cynthia Nixon, Yo Yo Ma, Marie Howe \nand Bill T. Jones; On Marianne Moore's \"The Fish\": Jorie Graham, Edward Norton, Conservation \nInternational scientists, and the passengers and crew of oceanographic vessel The Alucia; On \nElizabeth Bishop's \"One Art\" or Edna St. Vincent Millay's \"Four Sonnets.\" \nJeffrey, \nJust a quick note to thank you again for all the help you've given me. The generous contribution you \nmade last year to Verse Video Education is now in use (we've hired our new editor!). Once he helps \nus to plow through the work of this year, we'll begin to look forward to crafting educational content on \nthe literature of art, sport and play (these materials now including footage from recent shoots with \nShaquille O'Neal, Yo Yo Ma, Cynthia Nixon, Bono and others). 100K makes so much possible. \nBut, of course, you've also been a key preceptor as I've learned how --squirming all the way--the \nsausage really gets made in public television. I can't say I've been entirely successful in taming costs \nthere, but I've been far better armed and more mindful of what they should be after the stern tutorial \nyou administered. \nWhenever Templeton might be ready to evaluate another application, I'm ready for another proposal \nfor them. I wonder if you might arrange a meeting for me with the famous Bamaby? I can't yet afford \na grant writer, and so the time one of these suckers takes makes me think doing more advance \nreconnaissance is crucial. Would he meet with me? Kosher? I'd also love to meet with the Blacks as \nI get closer to making content on theatre. I hope that Debra is well. \nAnd heard there's another little Jeff in the caribbean... \nBest, \nElisa New \nPowell M.

It is like rolling the dice. what people don't understand is that many grants are not funded not \nbecause they are defective in any way, but simply because there is not enough funding to cover even a part of \nwhat comes in (there are thousands of applications and hundreds of millions of dollars of requests that go all \nthrough different kinds of review; it is hard to know what will make it through because different people make \nthe priority decisions at different stages of review; and it depends what other applications are in the pool in a \ngiven cycle). There is no \"direct\" route anymore. \nOn Sun, Dec 18, 2016 at 11:36 PM, Lisa New < \nDear \nJeffrey \n(and please see note at bottom), \n> wrote: \nThis end-of-the-year letter is to catch you up on developments and to report progress made in 2016 \nby Poetry in America, by its associated non-profit production company, Verse Video Education, and \nby (and with) our new Harvard partner, the Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning. Whether \nyou are a longstanding adviser and supporter of Poetry in America, or you've more recently joined \nour circle of proponents, your contributions, thought partnership and enthusiasm have made this \nyear's successes possible. \nLast fall, I knew this would be a crucial year. Goals for 2016 included moving our co-produced \ntelevision series, Poetry in America, toward a concrete release date (now entering post-production, \nwe launch nationwide in April 2018), converting our six HarvardX MOOC modules into for-credit \ncourses (now complete and being offered by Harvard's Division of Continuing Education), and \ngetting the word out on our first course developed especially for K-12 educators, Poetry in America  \nfor Teachers: The City from Whitman to Hip Hop. With a mission of creating and distributing the \nhighest-quality humanities content for a wide variety of learners, our projects now rely on a salaried \nproduction staff of five, a rotating corps of part timers and contractors, and a growing cohort of \nHarvard graduate students, undergraduates and interns whom we train in the public-facing \nhumanities. Growing fast, in 2016 we more firmly established Verse Video Education as a nimble \nand stable producer of humanities-based content (now including an archive of over 120 separate \ninterviews with distinguished discussants), while also defining a forward-looking partnership and \ngrowth strategy with Harvard. As 2016 draws to a close, I have much progress to report. \nVerse Video Education: Independent 501c3 \nIn April 2016, Verse Video Education, the fledgling production company I'd founded in 2014, \nreceived IRS approval and became a 501c3. Now capable of accepting philanthropic contributions, \nVerse Video Education has also begun to generate revenue by producing high-quality educational \nmedia for other institutions. Clients within our first year included Greenwich Country Day School, \nYIVO Institute for Jewish Research, Schlesinger Library, Harvard Institute for Global Health, and \nProject Zero. While philanthropic donations remain essential, work for clients allows us to amplify the \nimpact of philanthropic donations, not only permitting additional investment in our flagship \npartnerships with WGBH and Harvard, but also fostering development of new partnerships and \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019330 \nprojects. These include a video series on poetry and science now running with award-winning \nmagazine Nautilus, a collaboration with distinguished poet Robert Pinsky and his Favorite Poem \nProject, and an expansion of our poetry film series with partners at The Nantucket Project. Advised \nby a stellar and diversely talented board, Verse Video Education is looking toward sustainability. We \nare now discussing distribution of new content with a variety of stakeholders, including media \nproviders in China. \nNew Harvard Partner: Bok Center for Teaching and Learning \nMeanwhile, Poetry in America has deepened its partnership and formulated a plan for growth going \nforward at Harvard. This fall, Harvard's Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Mike Smith, \nendorsed the integration and expansion of my public-facing humanities work within the Derek Bok \nCenter for Teaching and Learning. As a Bok Fellow this year, and alongside Bok director Rob Lue in \nthe years to come, I will be working to substantially expand Bok's capacity and resources to train \nhumanists in 21st-century methods of public engagement-- developing courses, digital fellowship \nopportunities and also securing distribution outlets and partners for content produced in Bok by \nHarvard humanists. By next year at this time, I will be turning some of my attention beyond poetry \n(my favorite, but hardly the only humanistic mode of communication!) to create a wider base of \nhumanities materials for use in American schools and other institutions. We will begin integrating and \nanchoring Poetry in America content (on art, sport and play; on the environment; and on health and \nwell being) with content created by others. As I continue to experiment with use of digital media \nwithin my residential courses for undergraduates and graduates, I shall also be working with other \nfaculty and graduate students. My work at Bok will also facilitate collaborations between humanists \nworking across the whole university. Projects for 2017 include work with HarvardX on drama and \nShakespeare, with Harvard's Center for the Environment, with the Arts and Humanities Initiative at \nHarvard Medical School, and with several programs within Harvard's Graduate School of Education. \nLaunching in 2017: Our First Course Designed Specifically for Teachers \nVerse Video Education has allocated much of its staff time this year to bringing its first course \ndesigned specifically to support the American secondary classroom to completion. Poetry in America \nfor Teachers: The City from Whitman to Hip Hop draws on assets created at HarvardX, along with \nfootage captured with our TV partners and independently by Verse Video Education. The resulting \ncourse, designed for English, Social Studies, and Arts teachers, as well as for librarians, \nadministrators and others, provides deep content instruction as well as pedagogical training. \nCommon Core aligned, this course, the first of its kind, is now open for enrollment, and will launch \nJanuary 23rd. We are currently discussing group enrollments with major educational systems and \nreformers across the nation, and we are also raising scholarship funds for strapped enrollees. Over \ntime, we hope to play a leading role in improving literacy and in strengthening the humanities across \nthe American educational landscape. \nAiring Nationwide in 2018: Poetry in America, The Television Series \nIn May 2016, Verse Video Education was asked by WGBH and American Public Television to \nexpand its television series in development from 8 to 13 episodes, listed below. \nThe following episodes are entering post-production: \nOn Edward Hirsch's \"Fast Break\": Shaquille O'Neal, Pau Gasol, Shane Battier, Edward Hirsch, \nand an on-court pick-up basketball chorus filmed at Success Academy Charter School; On W.H. \nAuden's \"Musee Des Beaux Arts\": Ambassador Samantha Power, David Brooks, Peter Sacks; On \nRobert Hayden's \"Those Winter Sundays\": Vice President Joe Biden, Elizabeth Alexander, \nAngela Duckworth, Kevin Young, and a chorus of fathers and sons; On Carl Sandburg's \n\"Skyscraper\": Frank Gehry, Robert Polito, and a chorus of Young Student Poets; On Nas's \"New \nYork State of Mind\": Nas, Russell Simmons, Salamishah Tillet, Steve Stoute, and a chorus of hip \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019331 \nhop heads; On Galway Kinnell's \"The Grey Heron\": E.O. Wilson, Robert Hass, Laura McPhee; \nOn Gwendolyn Brooks's \"To Prisoners\": Anna Deveare Smith, Reginald Dwayne Betts, Li-Young \nLee and a chorus of exonerees from the Innocence Project; On William Carlos Williams's \"This Is \nJust To Say\": Woody Allen, Jane Hirshfield, Rafael Campo and a chorus of couples young and old; \nOn Langston Hughes's \"Harlem\": President Bill Clinton, Herbie Hancock, Sonia Sanchez and a \nchorus of children from Promise Academy; On Allen Ginsberg's Hymmnn from \"Kaddish\" and \n\"Hum Bom\": Bono, Juan Felipe Herrera and a chorus of clergy. \nThe production of the following episodes will wrap early 2017: \nOn Emily Dickinson's \"I cannot dance opon my Toes\": Cynthia Nixon, Yo Yo Ma, Marie Howe \nand Bill T. Jones; On Marianne Moore's \"The Fish\": Jorie Graham, Edward Norton, Conservation \nInternational scientists, and the passengers and crew of oceanographic vessel The Alucia; On \nElizabeth Bishop's \"One Art\" or Edna St. Vincent Millay's \"Four Sonnets.\" \nJeffrey, \nJust a quick note to thank you again for all the help you've given me. The generous contribution you \nmade last year to Verse Video Education is now in use (we've hired our new editor!). Once he helps \nus to plow through the work of this year, we'll begin to look forward to crafting educational content on \nthe literature of art, sport and play (these materials now including footage from recent shoots with \nShaquille O'Neal, Yo Yo Ma, Cynthia Nixon, Bono and others). 100K makes so much possible. \nBut, of course, you've also been a key preceptor as I've learned how --squirming all the way--the \nsausage really gets made in public television. I can't say I've been entirely successful in taming costs \nthere, but I've been far better armed and more mindful of what they should be after the stern tutorial \nyou administered. \nWhenever Templeton might be ready to evaluate another application, I'm ready for another proposal \nfor them. I wonder if you might arrange a meeting for me with the famous Bamaby? I can't yet afford \na grant writer, and so the time one of these suckers takes makes me think doing more advance \nreconnaissance is crucial. Would he meet with me? Kosher? I'd also love to meet with the Blacks as \nI get closer to making content on theatre. I hope that Debra is well. \nAnd heard there's another little Jeff in the caribbean... \nBest, \nElisa New \nPowell M.

Objective: an alliance between \nright-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections \nNEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru who \nwas Donald Trump's right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following the \nracist violence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the Daily \nBeast himself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (II Movimento), right in the heart \nof Europe and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view of the \nEuropean elections which will be held in spring 2019. \nObjective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor of \nthe Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in support \nof NGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist right, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019334 \naccused of plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in order to \nhave labour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current Minister of the \nInterior Matteo Salvini. \nThe ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in \nthe European campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and \nRome — is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great \"populist international\" of which he \nhas long since been dreaming. \nThe Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic \nadvice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European \nmovements. Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling \nfunding. \nThe aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of \"super group\" that if victorious can conquer up to a \nthird of the European Parliament in the elections next May. \nIndeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The \nAmerican strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress \n— and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data \nstolen from Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump emerged \nvictor. It is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to West. \nAnd he has already met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine Le Pen and the \nformer leader of the British separatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on Friday \nin Pennsylvania, USA, to a fundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman Lou Barletta. Without \nforgetting the Italians of Lega and 5 stars. Of them, he said: \"If it works in Italy, we can import the \nmodel anywhere\". \nThe Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. In \nshort, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries \nsupporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But in \nthe future the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe. Also because \nthe relationships with Trump have worsened after the revelations he made to Michael Wolff and \npublished in the scandal book \"Fire and Fury\". \"Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Paradise,\" \nBannon says now paraphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's Lost Paradise. \nHell in this case would be the dear old Europe and its democratic values. The \"army of darkness\" is \nalready among us. \nIn Sacratissimo Corde Iesu et Purissimo Corde Mariae et Castissimo Corde Ioseph. \n******* \nBenjamin Harnwell \nFounder and President of the Board of Trustees \nDignitatis Humanae Institute \nCell: -_________________________ \nOffice: \nIstituto Dignitatis Humanae \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019335 \n44 Via delle Fornaci \nRoma 00165  \nITALY  \n@ben harnwell \nwww.dignitatishumanae.corn \nII giorno 22 lug 2018, alle ore 15:38, Steve Bannon <I> ha scritto: \nWhat does this say??? \nBegin forwarded message: \nFrom: Maria Luisa < \nIMMIIIMI \nDate: July 22, 2018 at 9:11:58 AM EDT \nTo: Steve Bannon < \n<PHOTO-2018-07-22-10-02-17.jpg> \nSent from my iPhone \n>, Preate Alexandra < 1> \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru \nwho was Donald Trump's right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following \nthe racist violence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the \nDaily Beast himself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (II Movimento), right in \nthe heart of Europe and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in \nview of the European elections which will be held in spring 2019. \nObjective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor \nof the Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in \nsupport of NGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist \nright, accused of plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in \norder to have labour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current \nMinister of the Interior Matteo Salvini. \nThe ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in \nthe European campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London \nand Rome — is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great \"populist international\" of \nwhich he has long since been dreaming. \nThe Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of \nstrategic advice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme \nEuropean movements. Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and \nchanneling funding. \nThe aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of \"super group\" that if victorious can conquer up to a \nthird of the European Parliament in the elections next May. \nIndeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. \nThe American strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US \nCongress — and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019339 \nused data stolen from Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald \nTrump emerged victor. It is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right \nfrom East to West. And he has already met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine \nLe Pen and the former leader of the British separatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, \ncoincidentally, on Friday in Pennsylvania, USA, to a fundraiser in favor of the Republican \ncongressman Lou Barletta. Without forgetting the Italians of Lega and 5 stars. Of them, he said: \"If \nit works in Italy, we can import the model anywhere\". \nThe Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. \nIn short, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries \nsupporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But \nin the future the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe.

Objective: an alliance between \nright-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections \nNEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru who \nwas Donald Trump's right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following the racist \nviolence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the Daily Beast \nhimself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (II Movimento), right in the heart of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019348 \nEurope and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view of the \nEuropean elections which will be held in spring 2019. \nObjective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor of \nthe Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in support of \nNGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist right, accused \nof plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in order to have \nlabour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current Minister of the Interior \nMatteo Salvini. \nThe ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in the \nEuropean campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and \nRome — is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great \"populist international\" of which he \nhas long since been dreaming. \nThe Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic \nadvice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European \nmovements. Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling \nfunding. \nThe aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of \"super group\" that if victorious can conquer up to a \nthird of the European Parliament in the elections next May. \nIndeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The \nAmerican strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress \n— and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data stolen \nfrom Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump emerged victor. \nIt is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to West. And he has \nalready met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine Le Pen and the former leader of \nthe British separatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on Friday in Pennsylvania, \nUSA, to a fundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman Lou Barletta. Without forgetting the \nItalians of Lega and 5 stars. Of them, he said: \"If it works in Italy, we can import the model \nanywhere\". \nThe Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. In \nshort, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries \nsupporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But in \nthe future the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe. Also because \nthe relationships with Trump have worsened after the revelations he made to Michael Wolff and \npublished in the scandal book \"Fire and Fury\". \"Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Paradise,\" \nBannon says now paraphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's Lost Paradise. \nHell in this case would be the dear old Europe and its democratic values. The \"army of darkness\" is \nalready among us. \nIn Sacratissimo Corde Iesu et Purissimo Corde Mariae et Castissimo Corde Ioseph. \n******* \nBenjamin Harnwell \nFounder and President of the Board of Trustees \nDignitatis Humanae Institute \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019349 \nCell: \nOffice: \nIstituto Dignitatis Humanae \n44 Via delle Fornaci  \nRoma 00165  \nITALY  \n@ben harnwell \nwww.dignitatishumanae.corn \nII giorno 22 lug 2018, alle ore 15:38, Steve Bannon < > ha scritto: \nWhat does this say??? \nBegin forwarded message: \nFrom: Maria Luisa <____________________ \nDate: July 22, 2018 at 9:11:58 AM EDT \nTo: Steve Bannon <11111, Preate Alexandra < \n<PHOTO-2018-07-22-10-02-17.jpg> \nSent from my iPhone \nk \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

Mr. Abe's government has continued to \npush for a restart of the country's nuclear power program, and he heads to the Middle East on Saturday to promote \nJapanese exports to the region, including nuclear technology. \nMr. Abe also plans to lead Tokyo's delegation to Argentina for the International Olympic Committee's final vote, set for Sept. \n7, on the host city for the 2020 Olympics. Tokyo, 150 miles south of the stricken nuclear power plant, is one of three finalists \ncompeting to host the games. The others are Istanbul and Madrid. \nOpposition lawmakers here have demanded that Mr. Abe stay home and declare a state of emergency. \n\"The nuclear crisis is real and ongoing, yet the government continues to look the other way,\" said Yoshiko Kira of the \nopposition Japan Communist Party, which made significant gains in parliamentary elections last month. \n\"The government should declare a state of emergency right now, and intervene to stop the outflow of contaminated water,\" \nMs. Kira said at an anti-nuclear rally outside Mr. Abe's office in Tokyo. \nMr. Abe remains popular, and it is uncertain how large a liability the crisis at the Fukushima plant will become for him. \nBut it has become increasingly clear that the latest problems may be too large for the plant's operator, the Tokyo Electric \nPower Company, or Tepco, to handle. \nTepco has built nearly 1,000 tanks at the sprawling complex to store as many as 335,000 tons of contaminated water, the \nproduct of coolant pumped into the reactors to keep their cores from overheating, and groundwater pouring into their \nbreached basements at a rate of 400 tons a day. This week, Tepco said one tank had sprung a huge leak. \nOn Friday, Tepco presented an even starker view of the situation, acknowledging that as much as 220,000 tons of that water \nis stored in makeshift steel tanks similar to the one that is leaking. The operator said the 36-foot-tall cylindrical tanks, meant \nas a temporary repository for the growing amount of radiated water at the complex, used vulnerable rubber sealing and that \ntheir ability to withstand radiation was not tested. \nThe tanks are susceptible to leaks at the seams and through their concrete base, said Noriyuki Imaizumi, the acting general \nmanager of Tepco's nuclear power division. A nearby drain can carry any leaked water to the sea, Mr. Imaizumi said, and \nhigh radiation readings along a section suggest that water has already traveled through the drain to the ocean. \nThe makeshift tanks also lack water level gauges, making it difficult to detect leaks. Only two workers are assigned to \nchecking nearly 1,000 tanks on two-hour patrols twice a day, Mr. Imaizumi said. \nThe Nuclear Regulation Authority, which the Japanese government ordered to more actively advise and monitor Tepco's \nactivities at the plant, had told the company to begin transferring the water from the makeshift tanks to better-built vessels. \nBut after visiting the plant on Friday, an authority commissioner, Toyoshi Fuketa, said the vast quantities made doing so \nquickly \"unrealistic.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019414 \nA series of pits Tepco dug to store some of the water also began leaking earlier this year, forcing workers to transfer the \nwater into the steel tanks. \nExperts have said they suspect that more contaminated water is seeping out from under the melted-down reactors into the \ngroundwater and the Pacific. Elevated levels of radioactive cesium in surrounding waters seem to confirm those suspicions. \nTepco has said those leaks are not directly from beneath the reactors, but from maintenance tunnels that run along the coast \nand remain contaminated from the early days of the disaster. \nBut it also acknowledges that the water beneath the reactors is extremely contaminated, and experts say that if it does get \ninto the ocean, it will surpass even the leaks that occurred in the disaster's early days. \n\"That prospect scares me,\" Michio Aoyama, a senior scientist in the Oceanography and Geochemistry Research \nDepartment at the government-affiliated Meteorological Research Institute, said in an interview this month. \n\"It's the ultimate, worst-case scenario,\" Professor Aoyama said. \nBack to top  \nThe New Nuclear Craze  \nMark Bittman - New York Times \nThere is a new discussion about nuclear energy, prompted by well-founded concerns about carbon emissions and fueled by \na pro-nuclear documentary called \"Pandora's Promise.\" Add a statement by James E. Hansen — who famously sounded \nthe alarm on climate change — and, of course, industry propaganda, and presto: We Love Nukes. \nBefore we all become pro-nuclear greens, however, you've got to ask three questions: Is nuclear power safe and clean? Is it \neconomical? And are there better alternatives? \nNo, no and yes. So let's not swap the pending environmental disaster of climate change for another that may be equally \nrisky. \nDespite all-out efforts and international cooperation, Fukushima, which scared Germany right out of the nuclear power \nbusiness, still isn't under control. Proponents of nuclear power promise new and safer technology, but these discussions \nare filled with \"coulds\"; no such plants exist. Nor would they reduce the risks of proliferation. (Oh, that little thing.) \nNor would they do much to mitigate the all-too-infrequently discussed dangers of uranium mining, which uses vast amounts \nof water in the West — an area that can ill afford it— and is barely regulated or even studied. Thousands of uranium mines \nhave been abandoned, and no one seems to know how many remain to be cleaned up. The cost of that cleanup, of course, \nwill be borne by taxpayers, not industry. \nThen there's disposal of spent fuel, which is not contained at the same safety level as active fuel, itself a scary thought. \nDecades into the nuclear age there remains, incredibly, no real plan for this; a patchwork scheme by the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, which appears to be even more industry-friendly than most federal agencies, was rejected by an appeals court \nlast year, and the Obama administration is standing by its campaign promise (shocking, I know) to abandon the nuclear \nrepository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. \nThe economic viability of nuclear power is no more encouraging. Plants continue to close and generation rates continue to \ndrop. Operators may indeed continue to make money on reactors, but that's only because federal subsidies are enormous. \nInsurance costs are limited. Loans are guaranteed (the Solyndra loan guarantee was half a billion dollars; in contrast, loan \nguarantees for new nuclear plants may run $8 billion); cost recovery and return on investment are also assured for decades, \nand some operators are able to collect costs from ratepayers (and pay dividends to shareholders) years before plants come \nonline — even if they never come online. \nSo they're economical as long as you're the owner, because historically, subsidies for nuclear power have been more than \ndouble the expense of power generation itself. While estimates of the costs of power generation vary wildly — allowing both \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019415 \nproponents and detractors of any given power technology to make their cases — few of them take externalities (costs to the \nenvironment or to public health, for example) into account. And nuclear power's externalities could exceed those for any \nother form of power generation except coal. \nThat's why we're reducing coal usage — if we had a strong climate policy it would be gone in a couple of deades, and \nnuclear should be right behind it. It's likely that no new nuclear plants will be built before true renewables are able to take the \nplace of scary, highly damaging energy sources. \nWhich brings us full circle: the new proponents of nuclear power say that since nuclear power is arguably preferable to coal, \nmaybe we should subsidize the building of new plants. \nIf those were the only options, maybe that argument would be a sound one. But they're not. Energy efficiency (remember \nthat?), natural gas (imperfect, yes, but improvable) and wind are all cheaper. Even solar is already less expensive than \nnuclear power in good locations. \nSome studies show that renewables can generate 80 percent of our electricity in 2050, using current technologies, while \nreducing carbon emissions from the electric sector by 80 percent. Climate change fears should be driving not old and \ndisproven technologies but renewable ones, which are more practical. These technologies remain relatively small — non-\nhydro renewables were around 5 percent of the total last year— but they're growing so fast (wind and solar use have \nquadrupled in the last five years) that just this week the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission predicted \nthat solar power could soon begin to double every two years. \nUtilities are afraid that solar power will be to the electrical grid what PCs were to mainframes, or e-mail to the Postal Service: \na technology that will simply kill its predecessors. Coal and nuclear power are both doomed, and the profit-making power \ngrid with it. That's all to our benefit. \nBack to top \nPipeline-Capacity Squeeze Reroutes Crude Oil \nRussell Gold —Wall Street Journal \nMore crude oil is moving around the U.S. on trucks, barges and trains than at any point since the government began keeping \nrecords in 1981, as the energy industry devises ways to get around a pipeline-capacity shortage to take petroleum from new \nwells to refineries. \nThe improvised approach is creating opportunities for transportation companies even as it strains roads and regulators. And \nit is a precursor to what may be a larger change: the construction of more than $40 billion in oil pipelines now under way or \nplanned for the next few years, according to energy adviser Wood Mackenzie. \n\"We are in effect re-plumbing the country,\" says Curt Anastasio, chief executive of NuStar Energy LP, NS +0.58% a pipeline \ncompany in San Antonio. Oil is \"flowing in different directions and from new places.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019416 \nOn the Move \nThe amount of crude oil \ntransported by rail. road and \nwater skyrocketed in 2012_ \n400 mtbon Werth \nScum (NM 444.54ntratiao \nnso wag sin* )ignar \nU.S. oil production has reached its highest level in two decades, while imports have fallen dramatically. A system built to \nimport oil and deliver it to coastal refineries has become ill-equipped to handle rising production in Texas, North Dakota and \nCanada's Alberta province. \n\"All of the pipes are pointed in the wrong direction,\" says Harold York, an oil researcher at Wood Mackenzie. \"We are turning \nthe last 70 years of oil-industry history in North America on its head, and we are turning it on its head in the next 10 to 15 \nyears.\" \nWith oil prices persistently above $100 a barrel, companies drilling new wells don't want to forgo revenue while they wait \nyears for new pipelines. That leaves them with trucks, trains and barges to move an increasing amount of crude. \nOil delivered to refineries by trucks grew 38% from 2011 to 2012, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, \nwhile crude on barges grew 53% and rail deliveries quadrupled. Although alternatives are growing rapidly, pipelines and \noceangoing tankers remain the primary method for delivering crude to refineries. \nIn the Eagle Ford, a large four-year-old South Texas oil field, production has grown to more than 500,000 barrels a day, from \nless than 1,000 in 2009, according to state statistics. Getting that torrent out of the sparsely populated region has required \nmodifications to the oil-delivery system. \nFor example, last year NuStar reversed a 16-inch pipeline built to carry crude imported from Africa and Europe northward \nfrom the Port of Corpus Christi. Now, the pipeline flows south, taking delivery from hundreds of trucks that fill up at individual \nwells. Some of the 175,000 barrels a day moving through the pipe is loaded onto barges at Corpus Christi and towed toward \nrefineries near Houston. \nEarlier this year, Phillips 66 began putting some of this crude on ships for a 2,200-mile journey around Florida to its refinery \nin Linden, N.J. \nThe heavy trucks moving Eagle Ford crude are causing headaches for residents and local officials, ripping up roads and \ncausing traffic tie-ups. \n\"These are rural roads built for 10 cars an hour, and now it's 100 vehicles an hour, and 75 of them are 80,000-pound trucks,\" \nsays Tom Voelkel, president of Dupre Logistics LLC. The Lafayette, La., company started hauling crude in Eagle Ford in \nNovember 2011 and has more than 100 drivers full time in the region. \nThe Texas Legislature appropriated $450 million this year to repair and improve roads in oil-producing counties. \"It doesn't \neven begin to reach where it needs to reach,\" says Daryl Fowler, the chief elected county official in Cuero, Texas, about a \nhundred miles southeast of San Antonio. \n\"We've seen a fourfold increase in congestion around here,\" he says. \"The roads are crumbling.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019417 \nIn July, the Texas transportation department decided to convert 83 miles of state road in six oil-boom counties from \npavement to gravel, to reduce repair costs and slow traffic. \nTrucks filled with Eagle Ford crude are also heading 100 miles west to a barge canal. The first barge of crude departed in \nSeptember 2011, heading south toward the Gulf of Mexico and refineries near Houston. Now the canal moves 1.6 million \nbarrels a month, says Jennifer Stastny, executive director of the Port of Victoria. \n\"It's like putting your 5-year-old to bed one night and he wakes up the next morning as a 16-year-old, with the appetite and \ndemands of a 16-year-old,\" she says. \nIn North Dakota, trains move 69% of the state's 800,000 barrels a day of crude, according to state figures. Energy \ncompanies say they value rail's ability to deliver crude to the highest-paying markets. \nBut the deadly runaway crude train crash in Canada's Quebec province in July, which incinerated a small town and killed at \nleast 47 people, highlighted the risks of the mile-long crude trains crisscrossing the country. The U.S. government is \nimposing new regulations on oil shipments by rail. \nSome state regulators wonder if their local efforts leave them prepared for a train accident, in part because federal railroad \nrules pre-empt state and local control over trains. \nIn Washington state, \"we can't say [to train operators] you have to have oil-spill contingency plans in order to operate,\" says \nCurt Hart, a spokesman for the state's Department of Ecology. \"We do that for oil tankers, barges, large commercial vessels \nand refineries.\" \nHome to five refineries, the state levies a per-barrel tax on crude delivered by tankers and barges, which pays for spill-\nresponse officials and inspectors. The tax doesn't apply to rail shipments. \nThe American Association of Railroads says it is prepared for growing crude shipments because it has long carried \nhazardous cargoes. In 2008, major U.S. railroads carried 9,500 carloads of crude, the association says, and are on pace this \nyear to carry 389,000. \nMost industry analysts believe that while crude on trains will last, truck and barge traffic will decline once new pipelines \ncome into service. \nEnvironmental groups have criticized some pipeline projects, including the Keystone XL, meant to move Canadian oil to \nGulf Coast refineries. The federal government is still studying the Keystone pipeline and has yet to issue needed permits. \nSteve Kean, president and chief operating officer of Kinder Morgan Inc., KM! +0.30% one of several interrelated companies \nthat own or operate 82,000 miles of North American pipeline, says government agencies thoroughly vet new projects. \nFalling imports, infrastructure investments and increased manufacturing are just some of the benefits of newly abundant \nenergy supplies, he says. \"This has got to be one of the best things that has happened in our economy in the past 10 years. \nIt is better than the iPad.\" \nBack to top \nU.S. Electrical Grid on the Edge of Failure \nJeff Tollefson — Nature \nFacebook can lose a few users and remain a perfectly stable network, but where the national grid is concerned simple \ngeography dictates that it is always just a few transmission lines from collapse. \nThat is according to a mathematical study of spatial networks by physicists in Israel and the United States. Study co-author \nShlomo Havlin of Bar-Ilan University in Ramat-Gan, Israel, says that the research builds on earlier work by incorporating a \nmore explicit analysis of how the spatial nature of physical networks affects their fundamental stability. The upshot, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019418 \npublished today in Nature Physics, is that spatial networks are necessarily dependent on any number of critical nodes \nwhose failure can lead to abrupt— and unpredictable — collapsel \nThe electric grid, which operates as a series of networks that are defined by geography, is a prime example, says Havlin. \n\"Whenever you have such dependencies in the system, failure in one place leads to failure in another place, which \ncascades into collapse.\" \nThe warning comes ten years after a blackout that crippled parts of the midwest and northeastern United States and parts of \nCanada. In that case, a series of errors resulted in the loss of three transmission lines in Ohio over the course of about an \nhour. Once the third line went down, the outage cascaded towards the coast, cutting power to some 50 million people. \nHavlin says that this outage is an example of the inherent instability his study describes, but others question whether the \nteam's conclusions can really be extrapolated to the real world. \n\"I suppose I should be open-minded to new research, but I'm not convinced,\" says Jeff Dagle, an electrical engineer at the \nPacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington, who served on the government task force that investigated \nthe 2003 outage. \"The problem is that this doesn't reflect the physics of how the power grid operates.\" \nCritical order \nHavlin and his colleagues focused on idealized scenarios. They found that randomly structured networks — such as social \nnetworks — degrade slowly as nodes are removed, which in the real world might mean there is time to diagnose and \naddress a problem before a system collapses. By contrast, the connections of orderly lattice structures have more critical \nnodes, which increase the instability. The problem is that such orderly networks are always operating near an indefinable \nedge, Havlin says. To reduce that risk, he recommends adding a small number of longer transmission lines that provide \nshort cuts to different parts of the grid. \nBenjamin Carreras, a physicist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee who has conducted similar work2, says that \nnetwork theory can be useful for providing insight into electric grids but must be complemented with more complex models \nthat attempt to represent both the physical realities and the responsiveness of the modern electric grid. Although in some \ncases adding long lines can benefit the overall stability of an electric system, Carreras' work suggests that in certain \ncircumstances such an approach allows problems to propagate even farther. \n\"More connections may stabilize some processes, by, for instance, increasing the number of paths to generators, but also \nmay destabilize others,\" Carreras says. \"One cannot make generic statements on this topic.\" \nAlthough local outages caused by falling trees knocking down distribution lines are common, large-scale failures within the \ncore ne transmission lines rarely occur on a modern electric grid. Before 2003, the last major blackout in the United States \nhad been on the west coast in 1996, and more recently an outage has struck in the San Diego area. \nDagle says that the 2003 blackout stemmed from a combination of bad vegetation management — the first three lines \ntripped after sagging into trees but were all within their load rating — and a series of monitoring and communications \nbreakdowns. Vegetation requirements have since been standardized, and a new generation of sensors is providing grid \noperators with more information about what is happening across the grid at any given moment. \n\"Many more utilities have much more data,\" Dagle says. \"The next phase of our voyage is to make better use of that data.\" \nBack to top  \nTechnology — Full text articles \nBallmer Departure From Microsoft Was More Sudden Than Portrayed by the Company \nKara Swisher —All Things D \nAccording to sources close to the situation, the departure of CEO Steve Ballmer from Microsoft last week was more sudden \nthan was depicted by the company in its announcement that he would be retiring within the next year in a planned smooth \ntransition. \nIt was neither planned nor as smooth as portrayed. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019419 \nWhile the decision to go seems to have technically been Ballmer's, interviews with dozens of people inside and outside the \ncompany, including many close to the situation, indicate that he had not aimed to leave this soon and especially after the \nrecent restructuring of the company that he had intensely planned. \nInstead, sources said Ballmer's timeline had been moved up drastically — first by him and then the nine-member board, \nincluding his longtime partner and Microsoft co-founder and chairman Bill Gates — after all agreed that it was best if he left \nsooner than later. \nThat was due to a number of increasingly problematic issues on the immediate horizon — including a potentially nasty proxy \nfight, continued business performance declines and, perhaps most of all, that Ballmer's leadership was becoming a very \nobvious lightning rod. \nInterestingly, Ballmer actually indicated that he had planned on staying in his letter about his impending departure, noting: \n\"My original thoughts on timing would have had my retirement happen in the middle of our transformation to a devices and \nservices company focused on empowering customers in the activities they value most.\" \nThat sentence spurred much chatter inside the company, including the persistent rumor that Gates had dropped the bomb \non Ballmer. That sentiment was further underscored when Ballmer's letter contained no reference or thanks to Gates, with \nwhom he has been tightly tethered over the last several decades. Its absence has been much discussed internally at \nMicrosoft, where it has been seen as an unusual slight and a sign of a rift. \nGates also did not reference his longtime business partner in any celebratory manner in Microsoft's announcement. \"As a \nmember of the succession planning committee, I'll work closely with the other members of the board to identify a great new \nCEO,\" said Gates, in the entirety of the quote about Ballmer's retirement. \"We're fortunate to have Steve in his role until the \nnew CEO assumes these duties.\" \nOther sources cautioned that it was not indicative of tensions between the pair, but was done to minimize \"lame duck \nconcerns\" that might arise if Ballmer was portrayed as already out the door. \nThose sources also insist that Gates never asked Ballmer to step down sooner, although they acknowledge that he also did \nnot — as Gates had in the past — disagree that it was best that he move on. \n\"Did Gates instigate it? No,\" said one source with knowledge of the situation. \"But was he as supportive of Ballmer as he had \nbeen in the past? Maybe not.\" \nThat was still a big change, of course. Gates — who has always been and remains the key decision-maker on Microsoft's \nboard — had always been Ballmer's major backer, despite increasing pressure both externally and from other directors for \nhim to step down. \nGates had rejected such suggestions for years. That included former director and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, who many \nsources said had been one of the first to urge that the company replace Ballmer as CEO, as well as from a spate of Wall \nStreet investors complaining about the company's declining value in the Ballmer years. \nAs AllThingsD's John Paczkowski wrote on Friday: \"Here's one metric by which Ballmer will be judged harshly. On the last \nday of 1999, the day before he took over as CEO, Microsoft's market capitalization was $600 billion. On the day before he \nannounced his intention to retire, it was less than $270 billion.\" \nThat's a damning number, of course, coupled with a widespread sentiment that Ballmer had missed critical trends in tech \nunder his tenure. Despite a strong growth in revenue, investors and others had long concluded that Microsoft had thrived \nwhen Gates was CEO and waned under Ballmer's rule. \nStill, until recently, there has been no signal from the company indicating any change in top leadership. In fact, the \nmanagement reorganization backed strongly by the board a month ago had essentially placed Ballmer at the center of the \nstructure under a plan described as \"One Microsoft.\" \nAnd, at the time of the restructuring announcement in July, Ballmer's definite and clear message was that he was there to \nstay: \n\"Lots of change. But in all of this, many key things remains the same. Our incredible people, our spirit, our commitment, our \nbelief in the transformative power of technology — our Microsoft technology — to make the world a better place for billions \nof people and millions of businesses around the world. It's why I come to work inspired every day. It's why we've evolved \nbefore, and why we're evolving now. Because we're not done. Let's go.\" \nThough early in its rollout, the changes have been jarring and created a level of chaos at the company that has led to much \ngrumbling internally. It also did not help that the restructuring was quickly followed by a dismal 04 performance by Microsoft. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019420 \nAs I wrote in mid-July: \"Microsoft had a bad fourth quarter, mostly because many people are not using PCs any more. In \naddition, the tech giant took a $900 million charge related to having to cut the price of its Surface RT tablet, which had — as \nyou might imagine — an impact on results. Missed profit expectations, missed revenue, missed all over the ying-yang.\" \nWith the prospect that the next quarter could be weaker still and with numerous reports of late that there has been slowing of \nadoption from its new flagship Windows 8 offering, Ballmer and the board finally aligned to move his departure date sooner. \nMost critical to that decision, source said, were increased board worries that recent pressure from activist investor ValueAct \n— which has a large stake in the company — had a good chance of succeeding in its efforts to obtain a seat on the board of \nMicrosoft, especially if Ballmer stayed in place. \nAnd even if the software giant was able to thwart that from happening, said several sources, such a public fight is untenable \nfor the company, since it was likely to attract even more scrutiny to Ballmer's performance and perhaps even more investor \naction \nValueAct has until August 30 to notify Microsoft if it plans a proxy battle, and sources said it still wants more that Ballmer's \nretirement. In talks, said sources, it has asked for an aggressive stock buyback and also a dividend increase, which might \nassuage its efforts to garner a board seat. \nBallmer denied any pressure from ValueAct specifically in his decision in an interview with the Seattle Times, though \nsources said that was simply bluster. \nAnd, even with mounting pressure on him, Ballmer definitely portrayed the change as his decision in an interview he gave to \nZDNet's Mary Jo Foley last week, after his retirement announcement. \n\"I would say for me, yeah, I've thought about it for a long time, but the timing became more clear to me over the course of the \nlast few months,\" he insisted. \nWhen asked if Gates asked him to stay or go, he said no, apparently to both. \"Bill respects my decision. I mean, it's one of \nthese things when if it's — you know, ultimately these kinds of things have to be one's own personal decision.\" \nThat statement also struck many inside the company as a quick shift. Ballmer, said sources, had been jumping \nenthusiastically into business review meetings, as part of the new structure, over the last month. In addition, he had \nexpressed to many employees his excitement at being part of the changes he had initiated. \nBut, in meetings after the announcement, numerous sources inside the company said Ballmer seemed uncharacteristically \nchastened and quiet, in contrast to his usual confident and forceful manner. \n\"He was definitely not leaving and then he suddenly was,\" said one source. \"Even if today's Steve made the choice, it was a \nchoice yesterday's Steve did not want to.\" \nAnother source, close to the board, perhaps explained it best: \"If ValueAct got on the board, I think Ballmer finally realized \nthat meant it was going to be the hard way from then on out until he left and he did not want that for a company he clearly \nloves and has been his life.\" \nNow, those inside the company are turning to what comes next. While not everyone on the board thought that Ballmer \nshould step down without a new CEO in place, it's moot now as Microsoft turbocharges the process — in place for several \nyears now — to select its next leader. \nBut, though the committee is headed up by John Thompson, CEO of Virtual Instruments and the former CEO of security \nsoftware giant Symantec, most expect Gates — as usual — to be the key decision maker on that choice, too. \nA Microsoft spokesman declined comment. \nBack to top \nThe Decline of E-Empires  \nPaul Krugman — New York Times \nSteve Ballmer's surprise announcement that he will be resigning as Microsoft's C.E.O. has set off a huge flood of \ncommentary. Being neither a tech geek nor a management guru, I can't add much on those fronts. I do, however, think I \nknow a bit about economics, and I also read a lot of history. So the Ballmer announcement has me thinking about network \nexternalities and Ibn Khaldun. And thinking about these things, I'd argue, can help ensure that we draw the right lessons \nfrom this particular corporate upheaval. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019421 \nFirst, about network externalities: Consider the state of the computer industry circa 2000, when Microsoft's share price hit its \npeak and the company seemed utterly dominant. Remember the T-shirts depicting Bill Gates as a Borg (part of the hive \nmind from \"Star Trek\"), with the legend, \"Resistance is futile. Prepare to be assimilated\"? Remember when Microsoft was at \nthe center of concerns about antitrust enforcement? \nThe odd thing was that nobody seemed to like Microsoft's products. By all accounts, Apple computers were better than PCs \nusing Windows as their operating system. Yet the vast majority of desktop and laptop computers ran Windows. Why? \nThe answer, basically, is that everyone used Windows because everyone used Windows. If you had a Windows PC and \nwanted help, you could ask the guy in the next cubicle, or the tech people downstairs, and have a very good chance of \ngetting the answer you needed. Software was designed to run on PCs; peripheral devices were designed to work with PCs. \nThat's network externalities in action, and it made Microsoft a monopolist. \nThe story of how that state of affairs arose is tangled, but I don't think it's too unfair to say that Apple mistakenly believed that \nordinary buyers would value its superior quality as much as its own people did. So it charged premium prices, and by the \ntime it realized how many people were choosing cheaper machines that weren't insanely great but did the job, Microsoft's \ndominance was locked in. \nNow, any such discussion brings out the Apple faithful, who insist that anything Windows can do Apple can do better and \nthat only idiots buy PCs. They may be right. But it doesn't matter, because there are many such idiots, myself included. And \nWindows still dominates the personal computer market. \nThe trouble for Microsoft came with the rise of new devices whose importance it famously failed to grasp. \"There's no \nchance,\" declared Mr. Ballmer in 2007, \"that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share.\" \nHow could Microsoft have been so blind? Here's where Ibn Khaldun comes in. He was a 14th-century Islamic philosopher \nwho basically invented what we would now call the social sciences. And one insight he had, based on the history of his \nnative North Africa, was that there was a rhythm to the rise and fall of dynasties. \nDesert tribesmen, he argued, always have more courage and social cohesion than settled, civilized folk, so every once in a \nwhile they will sweep in and conquer lands whose rulers have become corrupt and complacent. They create a new dynasty \n— and, over time, become corrupt and complacent themselves, ready to be overrun by a new set of barbarians. \nI don't think it's much of a stretch to apply this story to Microsoft, a company that did so well with its operating-system \nmonopoly that it lost focus, while Apple — still wandering in the wilderness after all those years — was alert to new \nopportunities. And so the barbarians swept in from the desert. \nSometimes, by the way, barbarians are invited in by a domestic faction seeking a shake-up. This may be what's happening \nat Yahoo: Marissa Mayer doesn't look much like a fierce Bedouin chieftain, but she's arguably filling the same functional \nrole. \nAnyway, the funny thing is that Apple's position in mobile devices now bears a strong resemblance to Microsoft's former \nposition in operating systems. True, Apple produces high-quality products. But they are, by most accounts, little if any better \nthan those of rivals, while selling at premium prices. \nSo why do people buy them? Network externalities: lots of other people use iWhatevers, there are more apps for iOS than \nfor other systems, so Apple becomes the safe and easy choice. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. \nIs there a policy moral here? Let me make at least a negative case: Even though Microsoft did not, in fact, end up taking over \nthe world, those antitrust concerns weren't misplaced. Microsoft was a monopolist, it did extract a lot of monopoly rents, and \nit did inhibit innovation. Creative destruction means that monopolies aren't forever, but it doesn't mean that they're harmless \nwhile they last. This was true for Microsoft yesterday; it may be true for Apple, or Google, or someone not yet on our radar, \ntomorrow. \nBack to top \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019422 \nState Budgets and Healthcare costs — Full text articles \nHow to Charge $546 for Six Liters of Saltwater \nNina Bernstein — New York Times \nIt is one of the most common components of emergency medicine: an intravenous bag of sterile saltwater. \nLuckily for anyone who has ever needed an IV bag to replenish lost fluids or to receive medication, it is also one of the least \nexpensive. The average manufacturer's price, according to government data, has fluctuated in recent years from 44 cents to \n$1. \nYet there is nothing either cheap or simple about its ultimate cost, as I learned when I tried to trace the commercial path of IV \nbags from the factory to the veins of more than 100 patients struck by a May 2012 outbreak of food poisoning in upstate New \nYork. \nSome of the patients' bills would later include markups of 100 to 200 times the manufacturer's price, not counting separate \ncharges for \"IV administration.\" And on other bills, a bundled charge for \"IV therapy\" was almost 1,000 times the official cost \nof the solution. \nIt is no secret that medical care in the United States is overpriced. But as the tale of the humble IV bag shows all too clearly, it \nis secrecy that helps keep prices high: hidden in the underbrush of transactions among multiple buyers and sellers, and in \nthe hieroglyphics of hospital bills. \nAt every step from manufacturer to patient, there are confidential deals among the major players, including drug companies, \npurchasing organizations and distributors, and insurers. These deals so obscure prices and profits that even participants \ncannot say what the simplest component of care actually costs, let alone what it should cost. \nAnd that leaves taxpayers and patients alike with an inflated bottom line and little or no way to challenge it. \nA PRICE IN FLUX \nIn the food-poisoning case, some of the stricken were affluent, and others barely made ends meet. Some had private \ninsurance; some were covered by government programs like Medicare and Medicaid; and some were uninsured. \nIn the end, those factors strongly (and sometimes perversely) affected overall charges for treatment, including how much \npatients were expected to pay out of pocket. But at the beginning, there was the cost of an IV bag of normal saline, one of \nmore than a billion units used in the United States each year. \n\"People are shocked when they hear that a bag of saline solution costs far less than their cup of coffee in the morning,\" said \nDeborah Spak, a spokeswoman for Baxter International, one of three global pharmaceutical companies that make nearly all \nthe IV solutions used in the United States. \nIt was a rare unguarded comment. Ms. Spak — like a spokesman for Hospira, another giant in the field — later insisted that \nall information about saline solution prices was private. \nIn fact, manufacturers are required to report such prices annually to the federal government, which bases Medicare \npayments on the average national price plus 6 percent. The limit for one liter of normal saline (a little more than a quart) went \nto $1.07 this year from 46 cents in 2010, an increase manufacturers linked to the cost of raw materials, fuel and \ntransportation. That would seem to make it the rare medical item that is cheaper in the United States than in France, where \nthe price at a typical hospital in Paris last year was 3.62 euros, or $4.73. One-liter IV bags normally contain nine grams of \nsalt, less than two teaspoons. Much of it comes from a major Morton Salt operation in Rittman, Ohio, which uses a \nsubterranean salt deposit formed millions of years ago. The water is local to places like Round Lake, Ill., or Rocky Mount, \nN.C., where Baxter and Hospira, respectively, run their biggest automated production plants under sterility standards set by \nthe Food and Drug Administration. \nBut even before the finished product is sold by the case or the truckload, the real cost of a bag of normal saline, like the true \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019423 \ncost of medical supplies from gauze to heart implants, disappears into an opaque realm of byzantine contracts, confidential \nrebates and fees that would be considered illegal kickbacks in many other industries. \nIV bags can function like cheap milk and eggs in a high-priced grocery store, or like the one-cent cellphone locked into an \nexpensive service contract. They serve as loss leaders in exclusive contracts with \"preferred manufacturers\" that bundle \ntogether expensive drugs and basics, or throw in \"free\" medical equipment with costly consequences. \nFew hospitals negotiate these deals themselves. Instead, they rely on two formidable sets of middlemen: a few giant group-\npurchasing organizations that negotiate high-volume contracts, and a few giant distributors that buy and store medical \nsupplies and deliver them to client hospitals. \nProponents of this system say it saves hospitals billions in economies of scale. Critics say the middlemen not only take their \ncut, but they have a strong interest in keeping most prices high and competition minimal. \nThe top three group-purchasing organizations now handle contracts for more than half of all institutional medical supplies \nsold in the United States, including the IVs used in the food-poisoning case, which were bought and taken by truck to \nregional warehouses by big distributors. \nThese contracts proved to be another black box. Debbie Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Cardinal Health, one of the three \nlargest distributors, said she could not discuss costs or prices under \"disclosure rules relative to our investor relations.\" \nDistributors match different confidential prices for the same product with each hospital's contract, she said, and sell \ninformation about the buyers back to manufacturers. \nA huge Cardinal distribution center is in Montgomery, N.Y. — only 30 miles, as it happens, from the landscaped grounds of \nthe Buddhist monastery in Carmel, N.Y., where many of the food-poisoning victims fell ill on Mother's Day 2012. \nAmong them were families on 10 tour buses that had left Chinatown in Manhattan that morning to watch dragon dances at \nthe monastery. After eating lunch from food stalls there, some traveled on to the designer outlet stores at Woodbury \nCommons, about 30 miles away, before falling sick. \nThe symptoms were vicious. \"Within two hours of eating that rice that I had bought, I was lying on the ground barely \nconscious,\" said Dr. Elizabeth Frost, 73, an anesthesiologist from Purchase in Westchester County who was visiting the \nmonastery gardens with two friends. \"I can't believe no one died.\" \nAbout 100 people were taken to hospitals in the region by ambulance; 5 were admitted and the rest released the same day. \nThe New York State Department of Health later found the cause was a common bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, from \nimproperly cooked or stored food sold in the stalls. \nMYSTERIOUS CHARGES \nThe sick entered a health care ecosystem under strain, swept by consolidation and past efforts at cost containment. \nFor more than a decade, hospitals in the Hudson Valley, like those across the country, have scrambled for mergers and \nalliances to offset economic pressures from all sides. The five hospitals where most of the victims were treated are all part of \nmerged entities jockeying for bargaining power and market share — or worrying that other players will leave them struggling \nto survive. \nThe Affordable Care Act encourages these developments as it drives toward a reimbursement system that strives to keep \npeople out of hospitals through more coordinated, cost-efficient care paid on the basis of results, not services. But the billing \nmysteries in the food poisoning case show how easily cost-cutting can turn into cost-shifting. \nA Chinese-American toddler from Brooklyn and her 56-year-old grandmother, treated and released within hours from the \nemergency room at St. Luke's Cornwall Hospital, ran up charges of more than $4,000 and were billed for $1,400 — the \nhospital's rate for the uninsured, even though the family is covered by a health maintenance organization under Medicaid, \nthe federal-state program for poor people. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019424 \nThe charges included \"IV therapy,\" billed at $787 for the adult and $393 for the child, which suggests that the difference in \nthe amount of saline infused, typically less than a liter, could alone account for several hundred dollars. \nTricia O'Malley, a spokeswoman for the hospital, would not disclose the price it pays per IV bag or break down the therapy \ncharge, which she called the hospital's \"private pay rate,\" or the sticker price charged to people without insurance. She said \nshe could not explain why patients covered by Medicaid were billed at all. \nEventually the head of the family, an electrician's helper who speaks little English, complained to HealthFirst, the Medicaid \nH.M.O. It paid $119 to settle the grandmother's $2,168 bill, without specifying how much of the payment was for the IV. It \npaid $66.50 to the doctor, who had billed $606. \nAt White Plains Hospital, a patient with private insurance from Aetna was charged $91 for one unit of Hospira IV that cost the \nhospital 86 cents, according to a hospital spokeswoman, Eliza O'Neill. \nMs. O'Neill defended the markup as \"consistent with industry standards.\" She said it reflected \"not only the cost of the \nsolution but a variety of related services and processes,\" like procurement, biomedical handling and storage, apparently not \nincluded in a charge of $127 for administering the IV and $893 for emergency-room services. \nThe patient, a financial services professional in her 50s, ended up paying $100 for her visit. \"Honestly, I don't understand the \nsystem at all,\" said the woman, who shared the information on the condition that she not be named. \nDr. Frost, the anesthesiologist, spent three days in the same hospital and owed only $8, thanks to insurance coverage by \nUnited HealthCare. Still, she was baffled by the charges: $6,844, including $546 for six liters of saline that cost the hospital \n$5.16. \n\"It's just absolutely absurd.\" she said. \"That's saltwater.\" \nLast fall, I appealed to the New York State Department of Health for help in mapping the charges for rehydrating patients in \nthe food poisoning episode. Deploying software normally used to detect Medicaid fraud, a team compiled a chart of what \nMedicaid and Medicare were billed in six of the cases. \nBut the department has yet to release the chart. It is under indefinite review, Bill Schwarz, a department spokesman, said, \n\"to ensure confidential information is not compromised.\" \nBack to top \nStates scramble to get health-care law's insurance marketplaces up and running \nSarah Kliff and Sandhya Somashekhar - Washington Post \nWith a key deadline approaching, state officials across the country are scrambling to get the Affordable Care Act's complex \ncomputer systems up and running, reviewing contingency plans and, in some places, preparing for delays. \nOct. 1 is the scheduled launch date for the health-care law's insurance marketplaces — online sites where uninsured people \nwill be able to shop for coverage, sometimes using a government subsidy to purchase a plan. An estimated 7 million people \nare expected to use these portals to purchase health coverage in 2014. \nThe task is unprecedented in its complexity, requiring state and federal data systems to transmit reams of information \nbetween one another. Some officials in charge of setting up the systems say that the tight deadlines have forced them to \ntake shortcuts when it comes to testing and that some of the bells and whistles will not be ready. \n\"There's a certain level of panic about how much needs to be accomplished but a general sense that the bare minimum to \nget the system functional will be done,\" said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. \n\"It will by no means be as smooth and as seamless as people expected.\" \nOregon announced this month that it will delay consumers' direct access to its marketplace, opening the Web site only to \nbrokers and consumer-assistance agents in order to shield consumers from opening-day glitches. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019425 \n\"Even though we're testing now, once you actually have the system up, you don't know what the bugs will be,\" said Amy \nFauver, spokeswoman for Cover Oregon, the state agency implementing the law there. \nIn California, which has the nation's largest uninsured population, health officials have begun hinting that they may have a \nsimilar problem. \n\"It's a complex system, and there's a lot of navigation that needs to happen,\" said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for Covered \nCalifornia. He said the agency will know by early September whether the system will be ready in time. \nIf not, he said, customers will still be able to log on to the Web site and peruse insurance plans and view prices. When they \nget to the final step, however, they will not be able to sign up. They will have to contact a customer service representative to \ncomplete the final enrollment step. \nOfficials with the District of Columbia's Health Link decided to put off building a Spanish version of its Web site until later this \nyear, giving its staff bandwidth to complete other tasks they see more critical to the launch. \nUntil then, the District will have bilingual call-center workers and in-person helpers who will be able to help Spanish speakers \nnavigate the site. \nThe hiccups are troubling to advocates, who worry that there will be mistakes that result in people being erroneously \nrejected by Medicaid or denied subsidies to which they are entitled. They are concerned that impediments will discourage \nthe uninsured from signing up for coverage. \n\"There will be something up and running, but there will be serious, serious difficulties with it\" that could result in delays and \nerrors initially, said Robert H. Bonthius Jr., a lawyer at the Legal Aid Society of Cleveland. \"It's an extremely ambitious \nprogram, well-intentioned, that is going to be very difficult to accomplish, and it's going to be months and maybe years \nbefore it really gets sorted out.\" \nMuch of the difficulty stems from the information the federal government needs to determine who qualifies for which health-\nlaw program, including data on citizenship, income, residence and employment. State systems will need to communicate \nseamlessly with a federal data hub that pulls in information from the Department of Homeland Security and the Internal \nRevenue Service, among others. \nPresident Obama has predicted \"bumps\" and \"glitches\" in the initial launch of the exchanges. Health and Human Services \nSecretary Kathleen Sebelius has acknowledged a very tight time frame that has required the government to test the hub in \nimperfect conditions, but she has said it will still launch on time. \n\"Ideally what you would do if you were building a data hub that needs this kind of information, you'd put a piece together and \ntest that. You test it, if you will, sequentially,\" she said in an interview. \"We have to build and test simultaneously. ... It's a big \noperational issue, but all systems are a go for the first of October.\" \nSixteen states decided to build their own health-insurance marketplaces, with the rest leaving all or much of the task to the \nfederal government. Those states are now in the process of, or have completed, testing to share data back and forth with the \ndata hub. \n\"There were times when the hub had to be taken offline. ... So we couldn't test until they got it back online,\" said Jon Hager, \nexecutive director of Nevada's Silver State Health Insurance Exchange. \"But I think the end result, and everything I've seen, \nsays it will be ready.\" \nHager has invested significant time preparing contingency plans for his state, including one for a situation in which the \nfederal data hub does not work, though he said he believes that to be a relatively unlikely scenario. \n\"If there's a new rule, that could throw us into a quandary,\" Hager said. \"You could have, I don't know, a disaster or a fire. I \nthink we've got backup and contingency plans for everything.\" \nThe federal government handles all testing of these connections for states that did not build a portal and chose instead to \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019426 \nrely on the federally facilitated marketplace. \nState Medicaid programs, which typically serve low-income individuals, are also undergoing testing with the federal data \nhub. At least one state, Arizona, has not begun that work. It will start testing in September, a late start that worries the \nexecutive director of the state's marketplace. \n\"It's a concern that we're testing this late,\" said Tom Betlach, who runs the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System. \n\"Usually when you do testing, you have to go ahead and address any changes. Given the October 1st start date, I don't know \nmuch of it will be an iterative process.\" \nBack to top \n80 House members: Shutdown better than Obamacare \nCharles Babington —Associated Press \nMore than one-third of House Republicans urged their leader Thursday to trigger a government shutdown rather than pay for \nthe implementation of the health-care law they call Obamacare. \nA letter from 80 Republicans asked Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to resist any spending bills that would accommodate the \nnew health-care law, which is nearing a critical stage of signing up millions of Americans for health coverage. \nBecause it's virtually certain that President Obama and the Democrat-controlled Senate would reject such demands, \nleaders of both parties say the standoff likely would result in a partial shutdown of the federal government, similar to those \nthat occurred in 1995 and 1996. \nThe letter is mixed news for Boehner and other GOP leaders who view a government shutdown as politically unwise. \nThe federal 2013 fiscal year ends Sept. 30. New money must be appropriated by then to avoid a shutdown of countless \ngovernment offices and agencies. \nVoters chiefly blamed congressional Republicans for the mid-1990s shutdowns, and the fallout boosted Democratic \nPresident Clinton. Ever since, many establishment Republicans have urged the party to avoid using shutdown threats as a \nbargaining tool. \nBut a new generation of tea-party-backed conservatives rejects the advice. They say \"Obamacare\" — officially the \nAffordable Care Act — is so unpopular and unworkable that it justifies extraordinary tactics to block it. \nA possible solution to the budget impasse, often used in past years, would involve a \"continuing resolution\" to keep funding \nthe government at current levels. Many top Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, say it's \nimpossible to carve out money for Obamacare in any appropriations measure. \nThe House letter was authored by Rep.

While the club has existed in Mumbai since 2010, said Dhaval Udani, Givelndia's \nCEO, this was their first foray into the capital city. Mint was the media partner of the event. \n\"With this club, we wanted to create a platform for like-minded individuals to build a community of donors who share \nknowledge and vision; it will also help to facilitate giving effectively,\" Udani told his audience. \"Our aim is to help you get \nmore exposure and awareness of the different aspects of philanthropy; over the last three years this club has helped \nchannel more than Rs.18 crore to the lives of more than 10,000 underprivileged in India.\" \nRakesh Bharti Mittal, vice-chairman and managing director of Bharti Enterprises, along with speakers Anu Aga of Thermax \nand Amit Chandra of Bain Capital gave their perspectives on how and where to give effectively and on the future of Indian \nphilanthropy. Edited excerpts: \nRakesh Mittal set up the Satya Bharti school programmes in 2006. The aim was to set up 500 primary and 50 secondary \nschools of its own with a corpus of Rs.200 crore. After that, state governments began reaching out and Bharti began \nadopting government schools, creating a public-private partnership in delivering quality education to rural children. \n\"Given the new companies Bill, which has been passed by Parliament, I assume within the next two three months the rules \nwill be finalized; there is going to be a mad rush for seeking funding. Already, I get a letter every other day for supporting a \ncause. If I see corporates have been very powerful instruments and drivers of philanthropy, this comes from the wider \nwealth creation and management role which they do in their businesses. Today they are looking at doing more beyond \nbusiness, not because the government is forcing them, but because we cannot have islands of wealth. You cannot take this \ncountry forward if we are just worried about what I have and what I need for me and my family, and the ecosystem and the \nsociety around is crumbling. This country will not move forward.\" \n\"If I go back a few centuries giving had been a very rich tradition; it used to be that 10% of your income would be kept aside \nfor a cause. During those times more money went into either building temples or temples of learning, which are the schools \nand colleges. Pre-1990, Indian corporates were not giving that much, including the individuals, and there was a reason \nbecause we did not have sustainable wealth creation opportunities, either for ourselves, our families, or our large \nstakeholders as we were running the companies. \n\"This all changed in the post-1991 year of liberalization. In the last two decades, more and more, new age economies moved \nthis country to prosperous economic growth and suddenly you saw people wanting to give back to society because now you \nhave a model which was creating sustainable wealth for yourself.\" \n\"There are individuals who may give money and their time, but there are also entrepreneurs, young entrepreneurs who \nproduce products which are low in cost but make a huge impact for the people who use it. This is the brief India is looking at \nin the landscape today and this will be a stepping stone for the future.\" \n\"Giving at Bharti has always been part of our DNA, it was always our endeavour to make a difference. At the beginning, in \nthe mid-70s, we were more interested in creating businesses which could impact society at large. If I look at telecom, retail, \nagri and food processing we wanted to make a difference and not a buck. In 2000 we set up Bharti Foundation with the sole \nobjective of supporting the youth of India and enabling the underprivileged to come and compete with anyone. \n\"We started writing cheques and one day I felt that was not the purpose, the fact is there are 320 million children in the age of \n6-16, we talk of demographic dividend—absolutely yes, if we nurture this potential, but if we don't do justice to these children \nthere is a disaster which is waiting to happen. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019428 \n\"The way things are going I am not feeling very positive. I am a born optimist; we are spending billions of dollars but is that \nbeing delivered efficiently? The answer is no, all of us know that, and that's why we keep going back to the government; \npublic-private—partnerships is going to be the key to move forward, you have the resources we have the management \nexpertise let's join hands. And it has started moving.\" \nAnu Aga led Thermax Ltd from 1996-2004, after retirement she remains on the company's board of directors. The \nchairperson of TFI (Teach For India) was nominated to Rajya Sabha in 2012. \n\"My giving actually started when I lost my son, who was 25 and died in a car accident. Having studied abroad, poverty really \nbothered him. We who live in India, we become quite insensitive to seeing poor people, but he kept saying a substantial part \nof our wealth has to go to charity.\" \n\"It started in a very small way, it's not as if I gave away crores and crores at once. It started with me getting personally \ninvolved and I like that model very much, I'm not very happy with just writing a cheque and not getting involved. I was \ninvolved with Akansksha and then I was invited to join their board—it ran centres for slum children and I brought it to Pune. \n\"We have six schools, now this is done by the CSR wing of Thermax, but Shaheen (Mistry) then started Teach For India, \nwhich personally I support. \n\"From the family wealth, it's my daughter and I who decide on things. The bulk of our giving is to Teach For India and \nAkanksha, but we also give to an institute called Parivaar in Calcutta, which is for the poorest of the poor. In Bihar we are \ngiving to a school run by an ex-police officer for the rat-eating tribe. The main underlining thing is credibility. Giving without \nbeing involved does give me that little fear, but at the same time I would rather make a few mistakes than mistrust \neverybody. \n\"There is a lovely body called Caring Friends in Bombay, where a few hundred people meet informally. It's not an NGO, the \ntwo people who started it incubate NGOs which are new from their own money, and after a few years when they become \ncredible, bring it to the others and ask for money from them.\" \nAmit Chandra is managing director of Bain Capital and responsible for the firm's India initiative. He is also chairperson of the \nAkanksha Foundation that works in the field of education for less privileged children. \n\"Even though I came from a lower middle class family, we were always taught as children to give and share whatever we \nhad. For me the big inflection points were as I was working at DSP Merrill Lynch and I rose through the ranks, I got success \nrelatively early. I was running the firm before I was 35 but there was still a sense of unease that I had with everything I saw \naround me. I think the unease was on two counts, one was that by virtue of running what was the largest investment bank at \nthat time I got to work with a lot of families and I realized that wealth did not necessarily translate into happiness when you \nreally got to know a lot of these people individually. \n\"In fact, wealth built a sense of entitlement amongst the next generation, it built a sense of extreme bitterness amongst \nsiblings, and it often was a source of great degree of unhappiness. And another thing, having had the opportunity to study in \nthe West, I realized that when you look at leaders with legacy, a very vast percentage of leaders who had any degree of \nlegacy where the ones who had given back to society. These issues were beginning to bother me. \n\"My wife and I were inspired by what Chuck Feeney (Irish-American businessman and philanthropist and the founder of The \nAtlantic Philanthropies) did. We decided to cap the amount of wealth we wanted to have as a family, and so my wife and I \nwalked into a lawyer's office, and I transferred how much she thought was needed for her, my daughter, and to support my \nliving, and we said from this day onwards everything else basically goes to charity. \n\"What that did for us was actually incredible because our constraint after that point in time was to find good causes that \ncould be scaled up. That's where the Givelndia team came in extremely handy because we've set a budget every year for \nourselves which is higher than the previous year with the objective really being to effectively give away all our income every \nyear. \n\"I think giving your time is critical to being able to scale up giving your money. The two things have to go hand in hand. There \nis no substitute to actually giving time and approaching it the same way you would approach businesses and investments. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019429 \nThe biggest network we use is the GiveIndia network. Working with their team allows us to screen and monitor, before that \nwe were able to support a handful of NG0s. Now we have a reasonable portfolio across all the areas we are interested in. I \ndon't think that scale up would be able to happen if we hadn't leveraged the Givelndia team.\" \nBack to top \nGlobal Health and Development — Full text articles \nPat on the back or force for good: what purpose do development awards serve? \nMark Tran —Guardian blog \nDivyesh Thakkar has just returned from refugee camps in Ethiopia, where he was surprised to see portable solar lanterns \ndesigned by his company still in use three years after their distribution. \nThe batteries for the prototype lamps were expected to last only two years, but were still functioning at the Jijiga camp near \nthe Somali border. \n\"It's amazing they're still working and to see them changing lives,\" said Thakkar, who is based in Leicester. \"People are \ngoing to university thanks to the lamp.\" \nThe solar lantern, which looks like an old-fashioned kerosene hurricane lamp, won an innovation award last year at AidEx, \nan annual trade show bringing together suppliers and buyers of products for the aid industry. The lamp has a built-in solar \npanel to charge its four AA-sized batteries. \nThe lantern has an obvious advantage over kerosone-fuelled equivalents: with no flame or smoke emissions, it is safer and \nmore environmentally friendly. The batteries are made for 500 cycles, or about two years, but the longevity of the lamps in \nEthiopia has come as a pleasant surprise. In a novel twist, the lantern, which costs $38 (£24.50), can also be used to charge \nmobile phones. \nThe award provided a huge fillip for Thakkar's company, Sunlite. As word spread, relief agencies placed increasingly large \norders. About 100,000 of the lamps have been (or are being) used after emergencies in Japan, the Philippines, Thailand and \nSyria. \nSunlite makes 15,000 lamps a month at two plants in India, including one in a special economic zone in Gujarat state. \nNext month, there will be a new winner at AidEx in Brussels, the third year of the award. The innovation award sits alongside \na crowded field of honours in the development world, although AidEx is geared more towards humanitarian needs. \nAwards seem to be proliferating. Last month, 53 finalists met in Washington to showcase ideas to save the lives of mothers \nand newborns in developing countries. The award is given by the Saving Lives at Birth partnership, launched in 2011, which \nincludes USAid, Norway, Grand Challenges Canada, backed by the Canadian government, the UK's Department for \nInternational Development, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \nIn October, the Mo Ibrahim foundation will announce its prize for achievement in African leadership, established in 2007. \nPast winners include presidents Joaquim Chissano and Festus Gontebanye Mogae, of Mozambique and Botswana \nrespectively, although the prize is not awarded if no one meets the criteria. \nSceptics may wonder whether these accolades contribute meaningfully to development, or exist only to make donors feel \ngood while sidestepping more fundamental, structural issues. For instance, the Gates foundation awarded $100,000 to the \nCalifornia Institute of Technology last year for designing a solar-powered toilet that breaks down water and human waste \ninto hydrogen gas for use in fuel cells. \nThe competition was for \"next-generation\" toilets to improve sanitation in the developing world. Would that money have \nbeen better spent on supporting community-led total sanitation — a project to end open defecation that has had considerable \nsuccess? \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019430 \nCalestous Juma, international development professor at the Kennedy school of government and a nominator, judge and \npromoter of new types of prizes, sees awards as part of a complex ecology of financing innovation that includes many other \ninstruments. He believes there should be more prizes for humanitarian work and development. \n\"Doing humanitarian work may look like a thankless job. Yet it is driven by the instinct of empathy that makes us human,\" \nsaid Juma, author of The New Harvest: Agricultural Innovation in Africa. \"Honouring, rewarding, celebrating and inspiring \nwork in this area is more needed today than ever. This is an area that can use more societal recognition, especially at a time \nwhen the whole aid industry is under scrutiny.\" \nHowever, Juma says prizes need to be carefully thought out. \"Many organisations are launching them without thinking \ncarefully about what prizes can do or cannot do.\" \nThe AidEx challenge's lead judge, Michael Pritchard, inventor of the Lifesaver water bottle, says the award is not so much \nabout the money— £2,000 — as validation, although the publicity can be a much-needed boost. \n\"The validation goes an awfully long way to get the product developed and provides a big leg-up into getting it into the \nmarket,\" he said. \"It gets written up all over the world and gets the oxygen of publicity.\" \nAs for Thakkar, he says winning the AidEx award has been a positive experience: \"Winning the award made a huge \ndifference, it increased publicity. People look more favourably on us and [that] gives us an extra edge. We don't have to sell it \nas much. But we don't want to be just appreciated, we want the lamp to be used extensively.\" \nBack to top  \nEducation — Full text articles \nA Chance at Learning \nGinia Bellafante — New York Times \nThis year, a study administered by researchers at Harvard and Stanford drew significant attention for what it revealed about \nhow inadequately low-income students are represented at selective colleges and universities. Only 34 percent of the \nhighest-achieving high-school seniors whose families fell in the bottom quarter of income distribution — versus 78 percent \nin the top quarter — attended one of the country's most selective colleges, based on a list of nearly 250 schools compiled by \nBarron's. \nIn New York City, where a neighborhood like Bushwick, in Brooklyn, can seem like a satellite campus of Wesleyan and a \nprewar apartment building on the Upper East Side can feel like an Ivy League dormitory for 46-year-olds, there has been \nconsiderable philanthropic attention, of the kind other cities ought to envy, paid to finding the most gifted low-income \nstudents and putting them on a similar path. \nIn 1978, Gary Simons, a Bronx teacher, founded Prep for Prep with the goal of identifying talented students of color in the \ncity and readying them for attendance at private schools like Dalton and Groton and so on. Hundreds of the program's \nalumni have gone on to law, medical and business schools, and employment at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and \nTime Warner. \nA decade ago, hoping also to advance the best students attending public high schools, Mr. Simons and others founded \nanother organization, Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America, or LEDA, which draws exceptional children from around \nthe country, regardless of race, almost entirely from families who make less than $55,000 a year. Applicants are required to \nbe in the top 10 percent of their class, having taken the most difficult courses their schools offer. The 60 who gain entry to the \nprogram each year spend the summer before 12th grade at Princeton, studying ethics, political theory and public policy, and \npreparing for standardized college entrance exams. \nIn a wondrous righting of the current disequilibrium, however small its scale, they are tutored for those tests by the same \ninstructors who work with some of Manhattan's wealthiest teenagers: the staff of Advantage Testing, whose services cost \nparents up to $795 an hour. Arun Alagappan, the founder and president of Advantage and a major benefactor of LEDA, \nprovides his employees (whose résumés typically resemble those of the people at Google or McKinsey) pro bono. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019431 \nLEDA has been very successful. Of the 500 or so students who have graduated from the program, three quarters have gone \non to top-tier colleges, 30 percent of them to the Ivy League. Among LEDA's 2012 graduates alone, 19 gained admission to \nPrinceton, 11 to Georgetown and 6 to the University of Pennsylvania. \nLast week I took a walk around Red Hook, Brooklyn, with Joshua El-Bey, a LEDA graduate who was leaving in a few days \nfor his sophomore year at Yale. His family struggled as he grew up, moving often and ultimately landing in the Red Hook \nHouses, the borough's largest public housing development. His first memories of book learning, he told me, were the \nreadings his mother delivered from Genesis when he was 2. What was disconcerting about Mr. El-Bey's otherwise incredibly \ninspiring trajectory was how much of his success had depended on opportunities outside the public education system. \nBullied in middle school for his studiousness, Mr. El-Bey hoped to gain admission to one of the city's elite specialized public \nhigh schools, but he did not do well enough on the entrance exam. The free tutoring provided by the city for the test was \ninsufficient, he said. \nHe ended up at Edward R. Murrow in Midwood, Brooklyn, a good school whose academics were nevertheless surpassed by \nthe supplemental training he received as a scholar at Sponsors for Educational Opportunity, an organization begun 50 \nyears ago by Manhattan lawyers and advertising executives as a mentoring program to get poor minority students into good \ncolleges. Today it essentially provides a shadow education. In school, Mr. El-Bey told me, he simply learned to \"regurgitate \nfacts.\" \nPrograms like LEDA and S.E.O. are popular with wealthy, supremely educated donors, precisely because of outcomes like \nMr. El-Bey's. Just this May, the financier Henry R. Kravis pledged $4 million in matching gifts to S.E.O. \nAnd in a city as dense with talent and money as New York, the effects of such philanthropy can be effortlessly observed. \nWalking through his neighborhood, Mr. El-Bey ran into another alumnus of S.E.O., Luis Hernandez, who was about to begin \nhis freshman year at the University of Southern California. In a precocious accomplishment more typical in other \nneighborhoods, Mr. Hernandez had won a screenwriting contest for a film about obesity that had already made its debut on \nthe Showtime cable channel. \nAs a society we have begun to pay increasing and essential attention to gaining access to the top, but the brightest among \nus might do well to apply equal focus to how we might enhance the middle. \nMost students, rich or poor, will not go to Harvard, while plenty of working-class and poor students will go to colleges that \nserve them not nearly well enough. Not long ago, our son's caregiver, who is taking classes at LaGuardia Community \nCollege in Queens, showed me a paper she had written for a class in English composition taught by a teacher who was \nconsistently late and twice absent. It was on lbsen's \"A Doll's House\" and my husband had helped her. It incisively analyzed \nthe play's theme of 19th-century marital oppression and was impeccably written. \nWhen our nanny received her grade, she was shocked not to have done as well as she had expected. Her formatting had \nbeen imprecise, the teacher told her. And there was a problem with spacing. Content seemed not to matter much at all. \nBack to top  \nObama goes for college 'datapalooza'  \nNick Anderson —Washington Post \nIn President Obama's plan to overhaul higher education, which envisions using new federal ratings of colleges to determine \nlevels of student aid, there is a deep faith in the power of information and innovation to catalyze change in colleges and \nuniversities. \nUltimately, the belief is that these forces will make college more affordable. \nYet academia has witnessed and taken part in many waves of innovation in the past half-century, and affordability remains \nelusive. \nThe administration's faith is encapsulated in a word the White House used this week in a fact sheet about the plan: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019432 \n\"Datapalooza.\" Here's the reference: \n\"New college ratings will help students compare the value offered by different colleges,\" the fact sheet said. \"The \nDepartment of Education will enlist entrepreneurs and technology leaders with a 'Datapalooza' to catalyze new private-\nsector tools, services, and apps to help students evaluate and select colleges. The effort will be complemented by earnings \ninformation by college that will be released for the first time on [the] administration's College Scorecard this fall.\" \nWhat is a datapalooza? Apparently, it is a festival of, or related to, data. The White House and the Education Department \nhosted such an event Oct. 9. Students and parents are arguably awash in data now, much of it conflicting and confusing. \nSome would say more is better. \nFew would argue that better data would be best of all for the consumer. \nThe yen for better data is shared not just by Obama but also by some colleges. Start with graduation rates. \nNow, the federal government measures how many students graduate within four years or six years of starting college. But it \nonly measures that for students who are first-timers, who are enrolled full-time and who don't transfer from one institution to \nanother, omitting a huge share of the college population. Millions of students are part-timers. Community colleges with \nexcellent records of getting students into prestigious four-year schools are not rewarded for their efforts if those students fail \nto pick up an associate's degree before they transfer. Nor are four-year colleges that give transfer students or former \ndropouts a second chance and help them get a bachelor's degree. \nThe Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, which represents schools such as the University of Maryland, is \nspearheading an effort to improve this flawed metric, using not only federal data but also information from the nonprofit \nNational Student Clearinghouse to track degree completion for students who move from one school to another. \nOne question Education Secretary Arne Duncan will face, as he confers with colleges to create a ratings system within the \nnext two years, is what kind of graduation rate the government will use. Another is what kind of data the government will \nreport on income of college graduates. \nAll we know about the federal rating metrics at this point are rough sketches from the fact sheet, highlighting these potential \nfactors: \"access, such as percentage of students receiving Pell grants; affordability, such as average tuition, scholarships, \nand loan debt; and outcomes, such as graduation and transfer rates, graduate earnings, and advanced degrees of college \ngraduates.\" \nThe plan envisions that ratings will be tied to student aid formulas by 2018, if Congress agrees. That is a big if. It's also a year \nafter Obama's term ends. \nThere is nothing in the plan that would force states to give more funding to public higher education, one of the key cost \ndrivers in tuition. The president recognized the issue, touting a proposal that he has made before — a \"Race to the Top\" \nincentive fund of $1 billion for higher education. This fund would aim to spur state reforms and reward states that maintain \nstrong higher education funding, much as an identically named fund for K-12 education did in 2009 and 2010. But it is \nunlikely to win congressional approval. \nObama's plan highlights innovation. The president gave a major shout-out to a movement to award degrees based not on \nhow much time students spend in class but on how well they master their material, citing an experiment underway at \nSouthern New Hampshire University and one that is about to launch at the University of Wisconsin. \n\"So the idea would be if you're learning the material faster, you can finish faster, which means you pay less and you save \nmoney,\" Obama said Thursday in a speech at the University at Buffalo. This notion is indeed revolutionary in academia \nbecause most degrees are awarded based on the concept of a credit hour— which is a rough measure of the time a student \nspends doing work in and for a course. \nObama also underscored the online learning movement, which has gained steam in recent years, saying that it holds out the \npromise of reducing costs. Carnegie Mellon, Arizona State and Georgia Tech universities won coveted presidential \nmentions in the speech. So did the University of Maryland, in the fact sheet. Fans of massive open online courses, or \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019433 \nMOOCs, took heart from this. \nWhat exactly can the administration do to hasten technological innovation besides hosting datapaloozas? The fact sheet \npoints to two proposals: one that requires money, and one that doesn't. A \"First in the World\" fund of $260 million, \npresumably requiring congressional approval, would \"test and evaluate innovative approaches to higher education that \nyield dramatically better outcomes.\" Education officials liken this to a $650 million \"Investing in Innovation\" fund created \nunder the 2009 stimulus law that has been used as seed money for experiments in K-12 education. \nAnd the Education Department could cut regulatory barriers to innovation, whatever those might be. Education officials said \nFriday that they plan to solicit ideas from colleges on what government rules are hindering innovation. Many educators \nmight say that red tape gets in the way of experiments in distance learning and degree programs not organized around the \ntraditional credit hour. \nThe fact sheet asserts: \"The Department will use its authority to issue regulatory waivers for 'experimental sites' that \npromote high-quality, low-cost innovations in higher education, such as making it possible for students to get financial aid \nbased on how much they learn, rather than the amount of time they spend in class.\" \nBack to top \nMassively Online And Offline Too: How MOOCs Will Evolve In The Physical World  \nGiovanni Rodriguez — Forbes \nI was at the airport about this time last Sunday, when I overheard a conversation that's becoming quite commonplace. One \nperson was explaining to another what a MOOC was, but he couldn't remember what the letters stood for. As someone who \nregards himself as an amateur, ad-hoc, in-the-moment teacher, I felt compelled to help him out: \"Massive. Open. Online. \nCourse.\" He thanked me. He had been struggling to remember the \"open\" part of the MOOC message. And, even more \ninteresting, he had been struggling to remember the word \"course.\" \nOver the past few months, more and more clients and partners have been coming to me to deconstruct not just the acronym \nbut also the attributes of MOOCs. So often in fact that I have decided to write a short series on the subject. There are many \nthings to say about both the true impact and hype about MOOCs in the larger narrative that's emerging about disruption in \neducation. But from where I sit, what's most important to note about MOOCs in 2013 is something that the acronym does \nnot yet capture: the massive disruption we're seeing in education will be online and offline, too. \nExperience \nThere are at least three reasons for this. And each of these reasons deserves at least one post, but I'll be super brief here. \nThe first is that the online experience of MOOCs will almost certainly evolve in a way that teachers, students, and staff will \nlook to find ways to meet with one another. This will either happen by design (by intent and with care) or it will happen \norganically. Almost certainly, the producers of MOOCs will look to do this with some sense of design, while leveraging the \norganic power of networks to grow by themselves. And if you have been following the evolution of MOOCs, you already \nknow that the online experience is still a work in progress. My business colleague, Chris Bennett— a behavior designer and \ngamification expert— and I recently spoke about this: many are stuck in the old paradigm of delivering education to the \nconsumer, rather than leveraging the greatest assets of the new medium (co-creation, crowdsourcing, collaboration). By \nredesigning the online experience to become more interactive, innovators in the MOOC world will see the possibilities for \noffline experience. \nInventory \nAnother reason for thinking about physical space: while the world ponders the impact that the costs of higher education will \nhave on schools that are struggling to compete, the inventory of quality physical space that becomes available will appeal to \norganizations that need it. A couple of years ago, I had the privilege of serving as an advisor to a White House initiative that \ntraveled the country meeting with leaders in large spaces in a network of state and community colleges. As a former \ntheater producer, I was impressed with the availability and quality of these spaces. In theater — and other kinds of shared, \nquasi-spiritual, transformative experience — physical space is everything. Innovators in the MOOC world will get wise — if \nthey haven't already — to the existence of networks of spaces (there are many different networks, as I will show in a later \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019434 \narticle) and make them come alive for their clientele. \nOpportunity \nAnd I use the word clientele to make a final point: innovation in the MOOC world will not just come from educators, but from \nany organization that sees the value of massive online and offline courseware. As my own clientele have come to realize, \neducation in the 21st century is not just something you do before you become an adult but a modality of experience that \nempowers you throughout your entire life. No reason for schools to own the entire market for those kinds of experiences. \nBut I expect the most enterprising schools— especially those with great or underused physical inventory — to partner with \norganizations that now have the opportunity to rethink themselves for the education market. In the meantime, it may be time \nto reassess the MOOC acronym to make the opportunities more obvious. \"Massive Online Offline Communities\" seems \nmore like it. And unlike the online communities of the past, these communities are learning communities, driven by the new \nlifelong modality of transformative experience. Expect a land grab for branding and positioning. The disruption in education \nis just beginning, and the players are just becoming visible. \nBack to top \nWomen and Children — Full text articles \nIndian Police Arrest Suspects in Two Gang Rapes  \nSean Mclain and Khushita Vasan —Wall Street Journal \nIndian police Sunday were holding 10 men suspected of involvement in two highly publicized gang-rape cases—one in \nurban Mumbai, the other in rural Jharkhand state—highlighting India's struggles with sexual violence. \nIn Jharkhand in eastern India, police said they had detained five suspects in connection with the rape of a policewoman by a \ngroup of men who had set up a roadblock on a highway. The attack occurred Thursday, but wasn't reported to police until \nFriday, they said. \nFive other men were in custody Sunday in the Mumbai case, in which a 22-year-old magazine intern taking photographs of \ndilapidated buildings was assaulted Thursday in an abandoned textile mill in the city, police said. \nThe attacks come as the trial of five people accused in the December gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a \nDelhi bus entered its final phase. That crime sparked nationwide demonstrations and prompted the government to \nintroduce harsher penalties for crimes against women. \nProtesters took to the streets of Mumbai on Friday to decry the assault on the magazine intern in a city that has a reputation \nas a relatively safe place for women. In 2012, the incidence of rape in the Western Indian metropolis was about half the \nnational rate, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. \n\"I've always felt much safer in Mumbai compared to other Indian cities,\" said Sanika Prabhu, a television producer from \nMumbai. \"After this incident, I feel like I don't recognize this city anymore.\" \nMumbai police said the magazine intern was with a 21-year-old male companion when she was attacked Thursday. The \nassailants tied his hands with his belt and raped the woman from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m., an official at N.M. Joshi police station \nsaid. Medical tests confirmed the rape, he said. \nUnder Indian law, rape victims cannot be named in media accounts. \nThere were 24,915 reported rapes in India in 2012, according to the National Crime Records Bureau, including 233 in \nMumbai. The victims in almost half the Mumbai cases were between 14 and 18 years old. \nActivists say the number of rapes is much higher, as many go unreported. India also has a poor record on convictions, with \nonly around a quarter of alleged rapists convicted in 2010. \nIn Jharkhand, police said the rape of the police constable occurred at around 1:30 a.m. on Thursday, as she and her \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019435 \nrelatives were transporting the corpse of her brother-in-law for cremation. \n\"They were accosted by five or six young men who had set up a roadblock,\" said S.N. Pradhan, a police official in Jharkhand. \nAccording to the criminal complaint, the men stole 40,000 rupees ($625) and then ordered the woman out of the vehicle. \n\"Then they took her to the bush and raped her one by one while others stood watch,\" he said. \nThe rape wasn't reported until Friday, when police—investigating reports of highway robbery—discovered a photo of a \npolicewoman near where the thefts occurred. \"The superintendent of police asked her why her photo was there and only \nthen did she report the rape,\" Mr. Pradhan said. \nBack to top \nIs there any space in the development debate for African experts? \nAndrew Quinn — Guardian blog \nAt a 2012 TEDxChange conference in Berlin, African women's development fund CEO Theo Sowa turned the spotlight on \nan uncomfortable truth: African women may be the focus of many development campaigns, but they are rarely represented \nas drivers of the discussion. \n\"When people portray us as victims, they don't want to ask us about solutions. Because people don't ask victims for \nsolutions,\" Sowa told the audience. \nOf course, experts from Africa and other parts of the developing world are pioneering solutions to a vast range of \ndevelopment challenges on everything from improving maternal health to boosting sustainable crop output. Bringing their \nperspectives to light should be an integral part of development work, particularly as the international community \ncontemplates the next steps in the global development agenda beyond the 2015 MDGs. \nCelebrity advocates, government officials and major funders all have ready-made platforms for spreading their views —the \npower of their brand is often enough to build an audience. \nBut for those without immediate recognition, the task is harder. The Aspen Institute's New Voices Fellowship, launched this \nyear with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation, is one attempt to start figuring out an answer by providing both \nmedia coaching and contacts for development experts from Africa and, eventually, other parts of the developing world. \nDevelopment experts, so focused on their endless and crucial work, often neglect this area. Yet finding ways to leverage \nyours or your colleagues' public visibility is not as difficult as it sounds. Media training can be expensive, but enormously \nbeneficial. Persistence pays off. And above all, helping people to think like \"thought leaders\" can bring real results. \nOur fellows represents a cross-section of the work under way in Africa today, from a Congolese doctor seeking to build a \nhealth system in one of the remotest parts of his country to a Ghanaian tech entrepreneur devising new strategies for \nexpanding math and science education in rural communities. Each one is an expert, and each one has a story to tell. \nHelping them to craft their stories, and find an audience, have been our challenges. \nThe audience, at least initially, has been the easy part. The explosion of online and issue-driven media over the past decade \nhas created a wide range of outlets, many of which are eager to bring new voices to light. Development-focused media such \nas the Guardian's Global Development section, general interest aggregators such as the Huffington Post, and geographic \nspecialists such as AllAfrica.com and Think Africa Press all represent potential platforms for fresh writing about \ndevelopment issues. Even mainstream outlets such as CNN and Al Jazeera are welcoming new contributors for their \nopinion sections, while professional community portals such as Business Fights Poverty and the Guardian Global \nDevelopment Professionals Network can open the door to engaged specialists who care deeply about the challenges \nahead. \nAdd to this the increasingly crowded schedule of conferences and meetings ranging from the Clinton Global Initiative and \nSkoll World Forum to TEDx events held around the world and it's clear that there are a wealth of opportunities to reach \nimportant audiences with new stories. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019436 \nCrafting those stories has proved a little trickier. While the development-focused media has expanded, the standard for \nwhat makes a compelling blog, speech or opinion piece have not: clear writing and cogent argument backed up by solid \nevidence and examples. Putting the pieces together, and injecting the right personal note to make for a truly memorable \npiece, takes work, self-confidence and practice. \nFor our first New Voices Fellowship meeting in Johannesburg in June, we set up a series of training sessions on how to \nhandle media interviews, how to behave on camera, and how to build an online presence. But the most important part of the \ncurriculum turned out to be a crash course in confidence: how to believe in the importance of what you have to say. For \nmany of our fellows, unused to thinking of themselves as \"thought leaders\", the leadership component was new territory. \nWe learned that helping the fellows define their specific areas of expertise, and to understand how that personal expertise \ncan translate into important contributions to the global development discussion, was an essential starting point. One fellow, \nan expert on maternal health from Tanzania, found new confidence in the fact that alongside her medical degrees she has \npersonal experience as an African mother. Another, who specialises in poverty alleviation in Nairobi's slums, began to \nharness his own stories about growing up in those slums to buttress his points about development in informal settlements. \nThese are exactly the types of new perspectives that will inform and enrich development policy discussions. At Aspen, we \nwill be recruiting our next class of New Voices fellows starting mid-September, and look forward to learning from and \nworking with other organisations which are committed to expanding the dialogue about what works — and what doesn't — in \nglobal development. \nAndrew Quinn is director of the New Voices Fellowship at the Aspen Institute. \nBack to top \nChild marriage campaigners in south Asia receive $23m cash injection \nMark Tran —Guardian blog \nBy the age of 17, Zeenat had been divorced three times after forced marriages. She first wed shortly after puberty to a man \nwho abused her, an experience that recurred in her subsequent marriages. \nShe became so isolated that she did not go to the hospital or ask for help. Neither had she heard of India's Protection of \nWomen from Domestic Violence Act of 2005, which made her husband's violent outbursts not just wrong, but illegal. \nSadly, her story is all too common. Every year about 10 million girls become child brides, and one in seven girls in the \ndeveloping world marries before the age of 15. \nBangladesh, Nepal and India have three of the highest rates of child marriage, with 68.7%, 56.1% and 50% respectively of \ngirls married before the age of 18. Child marriage is not just a question of poverty — although that is a critical issue — but also \nof how girls are viewed in society. \n\"Even with higher levels of income, there is the practice of child marriage,\" said Care International's gender director, \nTheresa Hwang. \"It is an issue of status; girls are valued in a lesser way. In India, girls are not seen as 'added value'. The \nissue is squarely tied to gender equality and social norms.\" \nCare USA, the US arm of the anti-poverty NGO, and the American Jewish World Service (AJWS) this week received grants \nof $7.7m (£4.9m) and $15.3m respectively from the Kendeda fund to tackle child marriage in south Asia. Both organisations \nwill use the money to support local NG0s. \nFounded 10 years ago, the Kendeda fund worked initially on environmental sustainability in the US, but last year created a \ngirls' rights portfolio. AJWS will focus on India, Care on Nepal and Bangladesh. \nAll three countries have laws against child marriage, but implementation has proved difficult. Civil child marriage laws are \nnot enforced, and religious or social customs prevail. \nIn Nepal, Care supports groups such as Chunauti, which seeks to spread its message against child marriage among \nschools and local businesses. The local NGO persuaded factories to put anti-child marriage slogans in their production \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019437 \nmaterials. It also convinced a food catering business not to cater for child marriage ceremonies. \nFor Care and AJWS, the logical route is to work through local partners familiar with regional conditions and practices, and \nbased where the pressure points are. For the local NG0s, it shows they are not working alone on a difficult problem only now \nreceiving the attention it merits. \nThe UN high-level panel appointed by Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, to look at development targets to replace the \nmillennium development goals when they expire in 2015, has urged the recognition of child marriage as a key indicator of \nfemale empowerment. In another sign that child marriage is moving up the development agenda, Girls Not Brides, the global \npartnership to end child marriage, was formed in September 2011 to tackle the problem. \nEmpowerment can come through that catch-all term, livelihoods training. Groups such as Brac, the Bangladeshi NGO, for \nexample, have created clubs in Uganda where young girls learn to develop confidence through storytelling and songwriting. \nThey also learn more practical skills, from financial literacy and tailoring to agricultural work. \nBacked by AJWS, Mohammad Bazar Backward Classes Development Society in West Bengal takes a similar approach. \nThe organisation, which works with marginalised Muslim and tribal women and children in urban Kolkata, runs a school for \ngirls as well as vocational training for women in the rural area of Birbhum. \n\"We work to build girls' aspirations, promote girls' ideas of themselves when they don't have aspirations, and engage with \nkey decisionmakers — parents, teachers and religious leaders,\" said Javid Syed, Asia programme officer for AJWS. \nAJWS helped change Zeenat's life. It provided her with vocational training, allowing her to become financially independent \nand diminishing the likelihood that economic need will turn her towards another abusive marriage. If Zeenat does marry \nagain, the hope is that she will have the support of her family and the ability to leave the marriage if she chooses, in full \nknowledge of her rights. \nBack to top \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019438 \n",

I am so stressed out. Will finishe is in a day or \ntwo.. I can not write about the Katzenberg party. Maybe can just mention is happened in my hotel. But \nthe reason to go was to support Katzenberg and network. More to come. Peg \n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: Peggy Siegal \nSent: Thursday, March 07, 2013 08:51 AM \nTo: Peggy Siegal \nSubject: Oscar Diary \nIt's Thursday morning on Wilshire Boulevard and the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences has just \nopened it's doors for ticket pick-up for the 85th Oscar telecast. \nForty voting members, the distinguished director Norman Jewison and I are on a long single file line that \nsnakes thru the lobby patiently waiting to go upstairs to pick up our tickets. My seats were awarded via \na lottery system. We clutch our photo I.D. \nSuddenly, a messenger slips in wearing a smart khaki windbreaker and cuts through the line. He announces \nto the uniformed guard in a stage whisper, \"Dreamworks\", and as if Steven Spielberg himself had just \ndelivered the Gettysburg address, is ushered upstairs. \nThat is the final act of social justice of the \"Lincoln\" campaign. \nI am sleep deprived and jet lagged having just spent six hours on a flight sitting next Paula Wagner who \nis Tom Cruise's ex-agent turned Broadway producer for Jessica Chastain's \"The Heiress\". We discuss \nJessica's not so great chances to beat Jennifer Lawrence for Best Actress. I mention Harvey Weinstein's \nconcern about Emmanuel Riva's last minute surge. The French phenomena doesn't speak English, has never \nbeen to L.A. and it's like voting for a ghost, even on her 86th birthday. \nThis is the year I got phone calls in September from top studio executives announcing each are winning \nthe Oscar. Their euphoric giddiness is due to the quality of the films resulting in the priciest oscar \ncampaigns on record and astounding audience support at the theaters. \nSeven of the nine best picture nominees have taken in well over $100 million at the domestic box office \nto date, but it's the worldwide numbers in the millions that are staggering. \nTwentieth Century Fox's \"Life of Pi\" caused a tsunami at $595, \nUniversal's \"Les Miserables\" scored $412, the Weinstein Cos.' \"Django Unchained\" whipped up $395, \nDreamWorks' \"Lincoln\" delivered at $254, Warner's \"Argo\" captured $219, Weinstein's \"Silver Lining \nPlaybook\" danced to $187 and Sony's \"Zero Dark Thirty\" killed at $107 million. \nIn comparison, Sony Classics' \"Amour\" received $19 and Fox Searchlights' \"Beast of the Southern Wild\" \nworked up $19 million. \nHugh audiences having actually seen the films this year have an ear for the nuances of the Oscar race and \neveryone including Ben Affleck follow the bloggers religiously. \nSo by Thursday morning on line at the Academy the informed buzz was as follows: \"Argo\" takes best \npicture because is was most entertaining. The director snub to Ben Affleck was a Godsend as George \nClooney's advice came from far away Berlin where he was in pre-production on \"The Monuments Men\". \nWarner's president Sue Kroll kept the campaign clean and calm on the home front. \n\"Lincoln's\" victory is Daniel Day Lewis from day one of shooting, no pun intended. The suggestion that \nObama is our answer to Lincoln was interesting. Voters knew Obama secretly hosted three screenings in the \nWhite House, but they weren't invited. The Hollywood Foreign press were the biggest winners with Bill \nClinton's surprise appearance on their broadcast. DreamWorks' ran an impeccable patriotic campaign that \nthe media ate up. \nThe best director race had the most drama. Hollywood dreaded Spielberg loosing to Ang Lee. (Eventually \neveryone was thrilled Steven was anointed president of the Cannes Jury for 2013 the day after the awards \nshow.) \nThe voters knew beloved Ang Lee's three year boat ride was the technical miracle. Fox's $595 million \ninternational box office blew in the win. \nHarvey Weinstein having three horses running is always the most talked about. His loquacious Quentin \nTarentino was a lock for screenplay. Best supporting actor was a total toss up with a sentimental edge \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019465 \nto Robert DeNiro. We even applauded Bob putting his handprints in cement in front of Grauman's Chinese \nTheater. \nThe conversations continued about how our government put the cabasch on \"Zero Dark Thirty\" with their \narrogant denial of enhanced interrogation. Even MPAA President Chris Dodd could not help Mark Boal, \nKatherine Bigalow and Amy Pascal. \nAdditional chatter was the renewed last minute love for \"Les Miserables\". Clearly the most polarizing \nfilm in the race, this 27 year old theatrical musical seen by 60 million fans is now the talk of the \nOscar weekend. \nHugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Russell Crowe, Amanda Segfried, Eddie Redmayne, Sasha Baron Cohen, Helena \nBonham Carter and Samanthe Barks are making an historic one time live performance as part of Sunday's \ntelevision broadcast. Producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron's will attempt to razzel dazzel us with an \nhomage to movie musicals for three plus hours at the Dolby theater. \nBarbra Streisand, Adele and Shirley Basse's appearances also create high anxiety and a blood bath for \ntickets...hence the hysteria created by DreamWorks' messenger cutting the line. \nAfter checking into the iconic Beverly Hills Hotel, my home away from home for 30 years of Oscar weekends \nand meticulously laying out all the ensembles sent from Valentino and Ralph Rucci, I hit the party \ncircuit overdressed for life. \nDaisy... I can do this...fairly easily now...but I have a lunch at 12:30pm and important meetings. I am \nso distraught about all this pressure. I am calling you now. Peggy \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019466 \n",

But his \ntreatment of the Wall Street executives involved in the financial meltdown \nwas far less confrontational. \nby Jesse Eisinger \nProPublica, March 12, 2017, 6:22 p.m. \n1 Comment Print Print \nsearch Follow ProPublica \nEmail Updates by email \n_____Preet Bharara, then U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, at Trump \nTower in November 2016 (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) \nAfter his election in 1968, President Richard Nixon asked Robert Morgenthau, the US \nAttorney for the Southern District of New York, to resign. Morgenthau refused to leave \nvoluntarily, saying it degraded the office to treat it as a patronage position. \nNixon's move precipitated a political crisis. The president named a replacement. Powerful \npoliticians lined up to support Morgenthau. Morgenthau had taken on mobsters and power \nbrokers. He had repeatedly prosecuted Roy Cohn, the sleazy New York lawyer who had \nbeen Senator Joe McCarthy's right-hand man. (One of Cohn's clients and protégés was a \nyoung New York City real estate developer named Donald Trump.) When Cohn complained \nthat Morgenthau had a vendetta against him, Morgenthau replied, \"A man is not immune \nfrom prosecution merely because a United States Attorney happens not to like him.\" \nMorgenthau carried that confrontational attitude to the world of business. He pioneered the \nSouthern District's approach to corporate crime. When his prosecutors took on corporate \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019845 \nfraud, they did not reach settlements that called for fines, the current fashion these days. \nThey filed criminal charges against the executives responsible. \nBefore Morgenthau, the Department of Justice focused on two-bit corporate misdeeds \nPonzi schemes and boiler room operations. Morgenthau changed that. His prosecutors went \nafter CEOs and their enablers___the accountants and lawyers who abetted the frauds or \nlooked the other way. \"How do you justify prosecuting a nineteen-year old who sells drugs \non a street corner when you say it's too complicated to go after the people who move the \nmoney?\" he once asked. \nMorgenthau's years as United States Attorney were followed by political success. He was \nelected New York County District Attorney in 1974, the first of seven consecutive terms for \nthat office. \nThere are parallels between Morgenthau, and Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for the \nSouthern District who was fired by President Trump this weekend. \nLike Morgenthau, the 48-year old Bharara leaves the office of US Attorney for the Southern \nDistrict celebrated for taking on corrupt and powerful politicians. Bharara prosecuted two of \nthe infamous \"three men in a room\" who ran New York state: Sheldon Silver, the \nDemocratic speaker of the assembly and Dean Skelos, the Republican Senate majority \nleader. \nHe won convictions of a startling array of local politicians, carrying on the work of the \nMoreland Commission, an ethics inquiry created and then dismissed by New York's Gov. \nAndrew Cuomo. (This weekend, Bharara cryptically tweeted that \"I know what the \nMoreland Commission must have felt like,\" a suggestion that he was fired as he was \npursuing cases pointed at Trump or his allies.) \nBut the record shows that Bharara was much less aggressive when it came to confronting \nWall Street's misdeeds. \nPresident Obama appointed Bharara in 2009, amid the wreckage of the worst financial crisis \nsince the Great Depression. He inherited ongoing investigations into the collapse, including \na probe against Lehman Brothers. \nHe also inherited something he and his young charges found more alluring: insider-trading \ncases against hedge fund managers. His office focused obsessively on those. At one point, \nthe Southern District racked up a record of 85-0 in those cases. (Appeals courts would later \nthrow out two prominent convictions, infuriating him and dealing blows to several other \ncases.) \nHedge funds are safer targets. The firms aren't enmeshed in the global financial markets in \nthe way that giant banks are. Insider trading cases are relatively easy to win and don't \naddress systemic abuses that helped bring down the financial system. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019846 \nEven there his record was more mixed than is popularly understood. As Sheelah Kolhatkar \ndemonstrates in her propulsive and riveting \"Black Edge,\" when it came to bringing his \nbiggest whale to justice, Steve Cohen of SAC Capital, the Southern District blinked. They \ndid not charge him, only securing a guilty plea from his firm. \nPresent and former prosecutors say Bharara did not give much emphasis to investigations \narising from the financial meltdown, an approach shared by his boss, Attorney General Eric \nHolder. Justice Department insiders say many of those inquiries withered not because they \nwere unpromising, but because they had little support. \nBharara missed an opportunity by not bringing any significant criminal charges against \nindividuals in the wake of the collapses of Lehman, investment bank Merrill Lynch, the \ninsurer AIG, the mortgage securities and collateralized debt obligation businesses, or the \nmyriad public misrepresentations from bank CEOs about their finances. \nBharara and senior officials in Washington argue that there were no criminal cases to file \nafter the 2008 crisis. But the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan did pursue significant civil \ncases against the banks for their mortgage activities, cases that had to proove misconduct by \nthe \"preponderance of the evidence.\" And DOJ did win guilty pleas from the banks \nthemselves, an indication that prosecutors might have been able to charge individuals for \ntheir part in crimes their institutions had acknowledged. Academics who studied those years, \nincluding Columbia's Tomasz Piskorski and James Witkin and Chicago's Amit Seru found  \nwidespread patterns of fraud in the mortgage business. \nThe exception makes this failure all the more puzzling. As I detailed in 2014, Bharara's \noffice brought one case for misconduct during the financial crisis____against a mid-level \nbanker. Prosecutors charged Kareem Serageldin of Credit Suisse with overseeing traders \nwho knowingly misrepresented the value of mortgage securities. Serageldin pleaded guilty \nand went to prison. \nSerageldin's colleagues in the industry and others familiar with Credit Suisse found it hard \nto believe that he was the only person involved in that particular fraud. \nBharara's reluctance to pursue senior executives was seen in other investigations of big \nbanks. His office wrested a $1.7 billion fine from JPMorgan Chase over its complicity in the \nBernie Madoff Ponzi scheme, but it brought no charges against individual bankers. \nOne odd aspect of his tenure was the Southern District's willingness to defer to other \njurisdictions when it came to Wall Street cases. \nHistorically, the SDNY has been the leading enforcers of securities laws, nicknamed the \n\"sovereign district\" for its propensity to grab corporate fraud cases from elsewhere on the \nflimsiest of jurisdictional pretexts. Under Bharara, the southern district let other U.S. \nattorneys claim investigations into residential mortgage-backed securities, the instruments at \nthe heart of the financial crisis. Those other offices were not nearly as versed in complex \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019847 \nfinancial cases as their colleagues in Manhattan. In addition, Bharara's office ceded post-\nfinancial crisis investigations into foreign exchange and global interest rate manipulation to \nprosecutors working from the Justice Department's headquarters. \nLike Morgenthau, Bharara was a prominent figure in the New York landscape, given to \nwell-orchestrated press conferences and memorable sound bites. Like Morgenthau, he did \nnot leave office quietly, even thought the president has a longstanding right to name his own \nU.S. attorneys. And like Morgenthau, he may try to parlay his martyrdom into elective \noffice. \nBut if he runs on his record of convictions, as prosecutors often do, voters might want to \nconsider as well the list of possible targets he never pursued. \nLike this story?

Once again, a reminder to send me your delicious scoops \nand tips at kia@axios.com or find me on Twitter at @imkialikethecar. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020143 \nHot event alert: RSVP to our 2/26 event in NYC for interviews with NBA star \nDraymond Green, BBG Ventures' Susan Lyne, JPMorgan's Jennifer Piepszak, and \nEquinox CEO Harvey Spevak. \nTop of the Morning \nIllustration: Rebecca Zisser / Axios \nAT&T's proposed $85 billion purchase of Time Warner took another turn yesterday. A \nfederal judge hearing the Justice Department's lawsuit to block the deal denied a \nrequest by the telecom giant to disclose communications between Justice Department \nofficials, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and the White House about the \ndeal. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020144 \n• Why it matters: The ruling is a blow to AT&T's attempt to show that the \nlawsuit to block the deal is politically motivated by President Trump's antipathy for \nCNN, which Time Warner owns. AT&T says it wasn't asked to offload any assets as \npart of the deal until after Trump took office. \n• What they're saying: \"We respect the judge's decision and look forward to \nthe upcoming trial,\" said Dan Petrocelli, who is leading AT&T and Time Warner's \ndefense in the case, in a statement. \n• At a hearing on Friday, a Justice Department lawyer said that AT&T's \nargument for the documents \"didn't make sense.\" \n• Go deeper: Our report from the courtroom on Friday, when DOJ and AT&T \npresented their arguments. \nFund scoop: Niv Dror, who joined AngelList through its acquisition of Product Hunt \nin 2016, is raising a small early-stage fund focused on consumer products, multiple \nsources tell Axios. Dror declined to comment. \n• The fund will raise at least $1 million, though one source says it could go up to \n$2-3 million. \n• Like Product Hunt colleague Ryan Hoover's own VC fund, Dror's will be \nmanaged on the back-end by AngelList. \nSame old story: Yesterday, I grabbed coffee with Day One Ventures founder Masha \nDrokova, and heard a familiar—and still disappointing—story: While raising her fund, \nshe was told by prospective investors that she should get a male co-founder. \n• She initially considered the suggestion, she told me, before remembering it's \nrooted in sexism. \nSoftbank $$$: Softbank's Vision Fund is in early talks to raise additional funds from \nBahrain's sovereign wealth fund, Mumtalakat, the latter's CEO told Reuters. \n• The Persian Gulf has been a major source of funds for the Vision Fund: Public \nInvestment Fund, Saudi Arabia's main sovereign wealth fund, and Abu Dhabi's \nMubadala, are already investors. \n• And it's not the only one visiting the region's investors—funds focused on tokens \nand cryptocurrencies have also been fundraising in the area, I'm told. \nUnicorn stampede: We're not even two months into 2018 and yet, seven startups \nhave already seen their private valuations cross the $1 billion mark—earning \"unicorn\" \nstatus—according to Pitchbook. Last year: 53. The word \"overvalued\" comes to mind... \n1-:77-3:7A \n1-:77-3:7A \n1-:77-3:7A \nThe BFD \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020145 \nPhoto: George Rose/Getty Images \nBroadcom has adjusted its takeover offer for Qualcomm to $79 per share, down from \nthe its \"best and final\" bid of $82. The move is a response to Qualcomm's \nannouncement yesterday it would pay $127.50 a share for NXP, up from the $ilo it \nhad offered. \n• Why it's the BFD: Broadcom and Qualcomm's takeover dance has taken a \ndramatic turn for what should have been a boring transaction between two chip \ncompanies. \n• Bottom line: \"Broadcom has long said its acquisition of the San Diego-based \nchipmaker is contingent on Qualcomm buying NXP at the previously agreed price, \nsaving a large amount of cash Broadcom could hypothetically use for its own purposes \nonce the acquisition goes through... Qualcomm raised its NXP bid to secure support \nfrom activist investors who have piled into NXP and demanded a higher sale price.\" — \nBloomberg. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020146 \nVim? \nffintr. \nVenture Capital Deals \n• Moovit, an Israeli maker of a transportation app, has raised $50 million in Series D \nfunding led by Intel Capital, with participation from Sequoia, BMW iVentures, NGP, \nSound Ventures, BRM, Gemini, Vaizra, Vintage, and Hanaco. http://axioslink/fQSW \n• Vectra, a San Jose, Calif.-based cybersecurity startup, has raised $36 million in \nSeries D funding led by Atlantic Bridge, with participation from the Ireland \nStrategic Investment Fund, Nissho Electronics Corp., Khosla Ventures, Accel Partners, \nIA Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures, DAG Ventures and Wipro Ventures. www.vectra.ai  \n• FourKites, a Chicago-based make of supply chain management software, has raised \n$35 million in Series B funding.

Tenuous Finances May Provide Crucial Clues \nImportance: High \nshockingly it appears he has some money in real estate deals_ \nWill Cohen Cooperate? Tenuous Finances May Provide Crucial Clues \n2018-04-27 08:00:00.2 GMT \nBy Shahien Nasiripour and Caleb Melby \n(Bloomberg) -- In the two weeks since federal agents seized \nthe files of Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's personal \nattorney and fixer, a question has hovered: Will Cohen cooperate \nwith investigators? \nHis decision could depend in part on whether he can readily \nshoulder the enormous legal fees required to fight a federal \nprobe of this magnitude. \nAt first blush, Cohen looks like a pretty rich man. He \ndrives a white Rolls Royce, sports a $50,000 watch and owns a \nfair amount of Manhattan real estate. \nBut just as his loyalty to Trump is coming under scrutiny, \na more tenuous financial picture is emerging. A taxi business he \nand his wife built is deeply in debt and losing money daily, his \ncommercial real estate is throwing off only modest income, and \nhis legal and consulting work is on hold while he remains under \ninvestigation. \nCohen declined repeated requests to comment. \nThe owners of 32 New York City taxi licenses -- known as \nmedallions -- he and his wife, Laura, took out at least 16 loans \nbased on their once-soaring value, liens show. With the rise of \nUber and Lyft, the price of a medallion has fallen from more \nthan $1 million to around $163,000 in the past four years. \nIncome from the taxi business has plummeted, and millions of \ndollars of the Cohens' loans went under water. Their bank said \nin a November public filing that it had loans out to three taxi \nborrowers, and all were at high risk of default. \nSuspended Medallions \nUnpaid taxes and fines have piled up at the Cohen taxi \ncompanies, triggering a suspension of about half of the \nmedallions, city records show, squeezing cash flow. \nWhatever monthly income the cabs once produced almost \ncertainly fell well short of the debt payments owed to Sterling \nNational Bank, their Montebello, New York-based lender. Sterling \nhas foreclosed on operators in similar situations and sued them \nbut appears to be taking a less-confrontational approach with \nthe Cohens. On Tuesday, the bank agreed to new loans for their \ncompanies and to Cohen personally, public filings show. Sterling \ndeclined to comment. \nThe taxi business isn't the only part of Cohen's empire \nthat's suffering. The law firm Squire Patton Boggs said it ended \nits \"strategic alliance\" with Cohen after law enforcement raided \nhis offices, and the rest of his legal work could decline for \nthe same reason. Cohen, 51, makes others' ugly problems \ndisappear, a practice that was previously lucrative. Essential \nConsultants LLC, a company affiliated with Cohen, was paid \n$250,000 after he negotiated a $1.6 million payment to a former \nPlayboy model on behalf of Republican National Committee \nofficial Elliott Broidy, according to a Wall Street Journal \nreport. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020437 \nSean Hannity \nCohen has said in court that he had only three legal \nclients during the past year: Broidy, Trump and talk-show host \nSean Hannity. He gave seven others \"strategic advice and \nbusiness consulting.\" \nLast month Cohen said he borrowed from his home-equity \ncredit line to make a $130,000 payment in October 2016 to Stormy \nDaniels, an adult-film star who says she had sex with Trump. \nIn a Thursday morning appearance on \"Fox & Friends,\" Trump \ndistanced himself from Cohen, saying he did only \"a tiny, tiny \nlittle fraction\" of Trump's legal work, but it included \nrepresentation \"on this crazy Stormy Daniels deal.\" \nRussian Interference \nCohen is under investigation for bank fraud and violating \ncampaign-finance law. But his decade at Trump's side as his \nlawyer and enforcer could yield information he might trade to \ninvestigators looking into the Trump campaign and Russia's \ninterference in the U.S. election. \nStill, if he chooses to defend himself, Cohen does have \nassets. Companies he signs for own two investment properties \npurchased in 2015. The larger one, with 92 units on New York's \nUpper East Side, is 38 percent owned by Cohen's companies. The \nbusinesses also appear to be the sole owner of a downtown \nbuilding with 20 units. \nTogether they likely generate less than $1 million in \nannual net income for Cohen's companies after accounting for \npartner interests, expenses and financing costs, data compiled \nby Bloomberg show. Debt against the buildings is low, meaning \nthat Cohen could tap them for cash. Last October, the Cohens \nsold a unit at Trump World Tower, near the United Nations, for \n$3.3 million. \nCohen has been a savvy property investor. He previously \nowned four buildings in need of repairs in Lower Manhattan, \nrehabilitated them and sold them for $32 million in 2014, more \nthan doubling his initial investment. \n'Cautious, Methodical' \nRichard Guarino, a partner at Friedman-Roth Realty, has \nworked with Cohen on a handful of deals, including the purchase \nof his Upper East Side building. As a real estate investor, \nCohen is \"cautious, methodical, smart and, I think, \nconservative,\" Guarino says. \nCohen's current business partners are a family of New York \nreal estate lawyers headed by Herbert Chaves. The family, having \njust sold a plot of Brooklyn land to a partnership including the \nfamily company of Jared Kushner, were looking to reinvest their \ngains when they bought Cohen's Lower Manhattan buildings in \n2014. Months later, they partnered with Cohen to buy the Upper \nEast Side property, 330 East 63rd Street. Guarino, a broker on \nthe deal, says he dealt only with Cohen, who served as a \nrepresentative for the investor group even though the Chaves \nfamily companies hold the majority stake. \nPurchased for $58 million, the squat, brown-brick seven-\nstory building has only a $17 million mortgage, meaning Cohen's \nshare has at least $15 million of equity he could borrow against \nif his partners allowed him to do so. Another property at 133 \nAvenue D, not previously reported to be owned by Cohen, has at \nleast $5 million of equity not tapped by a mortgage. But more \ndebt means more risk and could hurt Cohen later if the taxi \nbusiness doesn't turn around to help cover higher interest \npayments. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020438 \nPark Avenue \nOne property that may prove harder to extract cash from: \nCohen's palatial Park Avenue home. Purchased for $5 million in \n2005, the sprawling 10th-floor unit used to be three separate \napartments and has four bedrooms. It could be worth $8 million \nor more, based on comparable sales. \nIn late 2015, the Cohens moved the property into a type of \ntrust designed to limit tax exposure when transferring property \nto heirs. The trust structure has tax consequences for typical \nmortgages, but those could be dodged if the Cohens took out an \ninterest-only loan. \nIn February 2016, Laura Cohen, in her role as a trustee of \nthe new entity, did just that, taking out a revolving $500,000 \nhome-equity line of credit against the property from First \nRepublic Bank. It was the first time the family had borrowed \nagainst the property since a loan of more than $2 million 11 \nyears earlier when they bought it, property records show. \nThere are also Cohen's in-laws, who may pitch in to a \nlegal-defense effort. Fima and Ania Shusterman, who haven't \nresponded to requests for comment, emigrated from Ukraine and \nbuilt their own taxi empire over decades while helping Cohen \nexpand his across New York and Chicago. They own three units in \nTrump World Tower. In an indication of their willingness to help \nthose close to them, the couple have lent $20 million to another \nUkranian couple in the taxi business, Semyon and Yasya Shtayner \nand their companies. \nRichard Kahn \nHBRK Associates Inc. \n575 Lexington Avenue 4th Floor \nNew York, NY 10022 \ntel \nfax \ncell \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020439 \n",

Objective: an alliance between \nright-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections \nNEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru who was \nDonald Trump's right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following the racist \nviolence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the Daily Beast \nhimself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (II Movimento), right in the heart of Europe \nand its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view of the European \nelections which will be held in spring 2019. \nObjective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor of the \nDemocratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in support of \nNGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist right, accused of \nplots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in order to have labour at \nlow cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current Minister of the Interior Matteo \nSalvini. \nThe ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in the \nEuropean campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and Rome \n— is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great \"populist international\" of which he has long \nsince been dreaming. \nThe Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic \nadvice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European movements. \nAnalysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling funding. \nThe aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of \"super group\" that if victorious can conquer up to a third \nof the European Parliament in the elections next May. \nIndeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The \nAmerican strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress — \nand in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data stolen from \nFacebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump emerged victor. It is not \na mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to West. And he has already \nmet, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine Le Pen and the former leader of the British \nseparatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on Friday in Pennsylvania, USA, to a \nfundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman Lou Barletta. Without forgetting the Italians of Lega \nand 5 stars. Of them, he said: \"If it works in Italy, we can import the model anywhere\". \nThe Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. In \nshort, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries \nsupporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But in the \nfuture the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe. Also because the \nrelationships with Trump have worsened after the revelations he made to Michael Wolff and published in \nthe scandal book \"Fire and Fury\". \"Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Paradise,\" Bannon says now \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020441 \nparaphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's Lost Paradise.

SeibAug. 27, 2018 9:25 a.m. ET \nBy \nGerald F. Seib \nSteve Bannon doesn't do subtle. So it's no surprise that there's nothing subtle about the new movie President Trump's \nonetime political guru has produced to energize the Trump base for this year's midterm elections. \nIt's entitled \"Trump at War,\" and it's an hour and 15 minutes of pure Trumpian adrenaline. It opens with a series of shots \nof Trump supporters being attacked by angry opponents, shifts to outtakes of Trump supporters proudly accepting the \n\"deplorables\" label bestowed by Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign, runs through a long series of \nangry ripostes at Trump detractors and praise of administration policy moves, and closes with dire warnings of the need to \nvote for Republicans in 2018 to head off efforts by liberals to impeach the president. \nMr. Bannon previewed the film for some Republican supporters in Dallas recently, but the big premiere is scheduled for \nSept. 9—chosen because it is the second anniversary of the speech in which Mrs. Clinton used the \"basket of deplorables\" \nphrase. The location? The very club in Manhattan where Mrs. Clinton made the speech, which has been rented for the \noccasion. \nAside from what they say about Mr. Bannon as a political provocateur, the film and its unveiling also reveal a lot about \nhow people in the president's circle increasingly see this year's midterm election: Its importance is growing every day; \nRepublican success starts with turning out core Trump supporters; and the best way to motivate them is by brandishing the \nfear of impeachment proceedings if Democrats win control of Congress. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020443 \nSteve Bannon believes the specter of impeachment will motivate mainstream Republicans as well as core Trump \nbackers. Photo: J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press \n\"This is all grass roots,\" Mr. Bannon says. \"It's 2016 all over again...This is Trump's first re-election.\" \nThe political calculus behind such thinking is pretty simple: In 19 months as president, Mr. Trump has hardened his grip \non his base of supporters and the GOP overall, but has done little to expand that base. \nMeanwhile, as the Labor Day kickoff of the fall campaign approaches, Republicans face a Democratic party whose \nactivists appear exceptionally motivated—to campaign, donate money and turn out in November. \nRepublicans need something to match that fervor. That something is the Trump base—and the best motivating tools are \nanger and fear. \nIn this case, that means specifically the fear that Special Counsel Robert Mueller, New York prosecutors and a \nDemocratic Congress will conspire to kick Mr. Trump out of office. That's why Republicans are talking about the specter \nof impeachment, not Democrats. Democrats know impeachment talk is a surefire way to motivate the other side. \nBut there's a problem in this GOP formula: A motivated Trump base is necessary for Republicans to head off disaster in \nNovember, but it's not sufficient, at least not if Democrats remain as energized as they appear today. The Trump base has \nto be married with more mainstream Republicans—the kind hardcore activists refer to as RIN0s, or \"Republicans In \nName Only\"—and with some independent voters. \nRight now, independent voters are hard to read. Their sentiments have been shifting around a lot in Wall Street \nJournal/NBC News polling in recent months. As a general rule, they have a low regard for Mr. Trump personally and \nappear weary of the atmosphere of constant crisis around him. But the polling also indicates they increasingly like how \nRepublicans are handling the economy, appreciate the GOP tax cut and think the party is changing the way things work in \nWashington. \nThat leaves moderate Republicans, of whom Mr. Bannon says simply: \"We need RINOs.\" \n=,== \nSupporters of President Trump cheer before a rally in Lewis Center, Ohio, earlier this month. Photo: Carolyn \nKaster/Associated Press \nThe Bannon calculation is that the specter of impeachment will motivate these soft Republicans as well as core Trump \nbackers. More conventional Republicans may be disdainful of Mr. Trump personally, but they also think the tax cuts, \nderegulatory policies and judicial nominations they like are imperiled if he goes down. \nSo, impeachment-scare talk, Mr. Bannon is calculating, is effective for RINOS too, simply for different reasons. For the \nTrump base, impeachment talk is a source of outrage. Soft Republicans dislike it for less emotional, more practical \nreasons. \nAll this means Republican candidates have a dual mission right now: Keep motivating those base Trump voters, who want \nfull-throated defenses of the president and odes to his hard-line immigration policies, while also luring out to the polls \nmainstream Republicans and independents who dislike the president but like lower taxes and less regulation. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020444 \nAnd if political advertising is any indication, candidates appear to be embracing both messages with nearly equal fervor. \nData compiled by CMAG Kantar Media on all political ads run so far this year show that a pro-Trump message is the \nmost common element of GOP ads. Next in line? Mentions of the tax cut Republicans pushed through Congress last year. \nWrite to Gerald F. Seib at jerry.seib@wsj.com \nAlexandra V.

That old faded picture of you sitting on the beach? Maybe it was the first time you ever saw the sea. A 2o-year-\nold picture with a childhood friend at their birthday party? Maybe it's the last picture of you together before you drifted \napart. Bored Panda has compiled a list of photos that look ordinary at first glance but become something special once you \nhear the stories behind them. Check them out in the gallery below! \nh/t: Bored Panda \n#1 Tadeusz Zytkiewicz Holding A Picture Of Himself \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020666 \nThis is Tadeusz Zytkiewicz — the first person in Poland to receive a heart transplant — holding a picture of himself and the \nperforming doctor, Zbigniew Religa, with his colleague, seen sleeping in the corner. The difficult surgery took 23 hours \nand Dr. Religa stayed up to monitor the patient's vitals. The photo, taken by American photographer James Stanfield, \nwas chosen to by National Geographic to be the best picture of 1987. \n#2 The Three Unsung Heroes Of Chernobyl \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020667 \nThe three men — Alexei Ananenko (second left) and soldiers Valeri Bezpalov (center) and Boris Baranov (far right) — \nrisked their lives o drain the fluid near the reactor during the Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster in Pripyat, Ukraine in 1986. \nAfter the plant's water-cooling system failed and a pool formed under the reactor to days into the disaster, there was a \nhigh risk that the lava-like radioactive substance could melt through the barriers and drop the reactor's core into said \npool, causing a steam explosion. Luckily, the men were able to drain the fluid and spectacularly, all three survived. \n#3 Cher Arni \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020668 \nCher Ami was the name given to a pigeon that saved 200 soldiers during WWI. The poor bird was shot multiple times \nand lost an eye and a leg but still managed to deliver a message from the trapped battalion. \n#4 'Behind Closed Doors' \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020669 \nPhotographer Donna Ferrato took this gruesome picture back in 1982 when photographing the lives of wealthy swingers. \nThe couple — Elisabeth and Bengt — were having an argument and it quickly escalated, resulting in Bengt hitting his \npartner. The photographer wanted the photo to be published but many publishers refused and she only managed to do so \nin 1991. The book was titled 'Living With the Enemy' and chronicled events of domestic violence. Thanks to Donna's \nefforts, Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act in 1994. \n#5 Behind The Counter \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020670 \nThe photo, taken by Fred Blackwell on May 28, 1963, shows three protesters — John Salter, Joan Trumpauer and Anne \nMoody — sitting at the counter of a white-only Woolworth's five-and-dime store in Jackson while an angry mob pours \nketchup, sugar, and mustard on them. The three protesters were from the Tougaloo College, a black college that went on \nto become the core of the civil rights movement in Mississippi. \n#6 'Wait For Me, Daddy' \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020671 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020672 \nThis moving photo was captured by Claude Detloff in Vancouver during WWII as soldiers of the Duke of Connaught's \nOwn Rifles were marching off to fight. The boy's father safely returned home in October 1945. \n#7 Childhood Friends \nOn April 6, 1972, workers of French company Joint Francais went on strike and were confronted by the riot police. This \npicture, captured by Jacques Gourmelen, shows two men — Guy Burmieux, a worker at the company, and Jean-Yvon \nAntignac, a riot policeman — standing face to face. In that moment, the two recognized eachother — they were childhood \nfriends. \"I saw him [Guy Burmieux] go toward his friend and grab him by the collar. He wept with rage and told him, 'Go \nahead and hit me while you're at it!' The other one didn't move a muscle,\" recalled the photographer. \n#8 'Burst Of Joy' \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020673 \nThis photo, taken in 1973 and titled 'Burst of Joy', shows United States Air Force Lt Col Robert L. Stirm reuniting with his \nfamily after spending over 5 years as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam. The girl with the open arms is Robert's 15-year-\nold daughter Lorrie. The photo was taken by Associated Press photographer Slava \"Sal\" Veder and won a Pulitzer \nprize. \"You could feel the energy and the raw emotion in the air,\" recalled the photographer. \n#9 The Youngest Mother \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020674 \nLina Medina, born on 23 September, 1933, was the youngest woman ever to give birth. She did so when she was just 5-\nyears-old. Turns out Lina was born with a rare condition called 'precocious puberty', a condition where sexual \ndevelopment happens at an early age. Lina gave birth on May 14, 1939, via a cesarean section, since her pelvis was too \nsmall. The child, named Gerardo, was born completely healthy but the father was never found out. \n#10 `Terezka's Scrawls' \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020675 \nThe photo, taken by photographer David Seymour in 1948, shows Terezka, a young girl living in the home for emotionally \ndisturbed children located in Warsaw, 1948. The girl grew up in a concentration camp and the past horrors can still be \nseen on her face. \n#11 Two Brothers \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020676 \nWhat might look like a fun photo at first glance, showing two brothers, Michael and Sean McQuilken, is actually the last \npicture of them before being struck by lightning. The photo was taken at Moro Rock in California's Sequoia National Park \non August 20, 1975. \"At the time, we thought this was humorous. I took a photo of Mary (their sister) and Mary took a \nphoto of Sean and me. I raised my right hand into the air and the ring I had on began to buzz so loudly that everyone \ncould hear it. I found myself on the ground with the others. Sean was collapsed and huddled on his knees. Smoke was \npouring from his back,\" recalled Michael. All of them survived but, sadly, Sean took his own life in 1989. \n#12 Moving An Apartment Building To Create A \nBoulevard In Alba Iulia, Romania \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020677 \nThis amazing photo, taken in Alba Iulia, Romania back in 1987, shows construction workers moving a whole house after \nit was deemed to be in the way of a new boulevard. The building was split into two parts and moved 55 meters to the side. \nThe workers moved the 7,600-ton building in just six hours. \n#13 Motel Manager Pouring Acid In The Water \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020678 \nThe photograph, taken by Horace Cort, shows Jimmy Brock, manager of the Monson Motor Lodge motel pouring a bottle \nof muriatic acid into the pool to scare protesters swimming in the pool. Martin Luther King Jr was arrested for \ntrespassing at the same motel seven days prior and the protesters planned a swim-in in the motel's pool. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020679 \n#14 Children For Sale \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020680 \nImage source: Rare Historical Photos  \nThis photo, taken in 1948, shows Lucille Chalifoux, a 24-year-old woman auctioning off her children after her husband \nlost his job and the family was forced to move from their apartment. Lucille was pregnant with her fifth child at the time. \nAll of the children were bought off and rumors say they were forced into slavery. \n#15 'Tragedy By The Sea' \nPhotographer John Gaunt was in the front yard of his beach home when he heard his neighbor shouting \"something's \nhappening on the beach!\". The photographer quickly grabbed his camera and rushed to the beach where he found a \ncouple by the water clutching each other. Their 19-month-old son had just wandered off and vanished into the water. This \nheartbreaking photo went on to wn the Pulitzer Prize. \n#16 'An Armenian Man Dances For His Lost Son In The \nMountains Near Aparan, Armenia' \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020681 \n\"In 1998, I found myself in Aparan, a large town an hour's drive from Armenia's capital, Yerevan. A local dance troupe \nwas performing that evening, in the open air, with most of the suburb in attendance. As soon as I took my first shot, an \nold man approached me,\" said French photographer Antoine Agoudjian. \"Tears streamed down his face. He told me that \nhis son had died. That he had been electrocuted, that he was his pride and joy, and that I looked just like him. He broke \ninto sobs and moved towards me with outstretched arms. His name was Ishran. I asked if he would dance for me, and he \nbegan dancing. The troupe paused and perched on an outcrop of rocks in the background. It was beautiful, not because \nthe man is beautiful, but because he represents something deep inside the collective consciousness of the Armenian \ncommunity: a celebratory resilience in the face of overwhelming loss.\" \n#17 Class Of 1999 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020682 \nWhat looks like an innocent high school picture, actually hides a dark secret — the teens on the left, pretending to point \nguns at the camera, were Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the same people that organized and carried out the Columbine \nshooting. \n4618 Atomic Bomb Detonation \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020683 \nImage source: Reddit  \nHarold Edgerton was an MIT physicist, photographer, and pioneer of strobe light photography — a type of photography \nthat allowed to capture incredibly fast moving things clearly. This photograph was taken at the Nevada ProvingGrounds \nby Edgerton on June 5, 1952, during the operation Operation Tumbler-Snapper test series. \n#19 'flight Of Refugees Across Wrecked Bridge In Korea' \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020684 \nBack in 1950, Associatede Press photographer Max Desfor took this dramatic photograph of refugees trying to cross a \ndestroyed Pyongyang bridge, over the Taedong River in North Korea to escape the country. The photo won the Pulitzer \nPrize in 1951. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020685 \n#20 \"I Will Not Be Sued! I Have The Voice Of An Angel! \nNo Man Can Sue Me.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020686 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020687 \nAfter giving an amazing performance in Chicago's Civic Opera House back on November 17, 1955, opera singer Maria \nCallas was served a court summons by U.S. Marshal Stanley Pringle and Deputy Sheriff Dan Smith for breach of contract. \nUpon being presented with the document, Maria screamed \"I will not be sued!

No man can \nsue me.\" The singer was nicknamed \"The Tigress\" and vowed never to return to Chicago again. \n#21 Young Osama \nIn this family picture taken in Sweden in 1971, the man second from the left seen in a brown shirt is no one else but \nOsama bin Laden. \n#22 Rajiv Gandhi \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020688 \nJust moments after this picture was taken, Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was killed by the girl seen on the bottom \nleft wearing orange flowers — she was wearing a suicide west. \n#23 SS Gran dcamp \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020689 \nWhat might seem like an ordinary picture at first, shows a fire breaking out aboard the ship called SS Grandcamp. The \npeople on the dock are members of the Texas City Volunteer Fire Department, attempting to extinguish the fire. Just \nmoments after the picture was taken, the ship exploded and caused what is still known as the largest non-nuclear \nexplosion in human history. Over 5,000 people were injured and 468 died in this 1947 tragedy. \n#24 Soviet Soldiers Harassing A German Woman \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020690 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020691 \nDuring the Soviet occupation of Germany, mass rapes took place in the occupied territory during the war and after. Some \nhistorians say that as many as 2 million German women might have been raped. \n#25 'Leap Into Freedom' \nImage source: TIME \nAfter post-war Berlin was divided into four occupation zones, the living conditions were greatly different in each one. \nBetween 1949 and 1961, about 2.5 million people fled from Soviet-occupied East Germany. Barricades and barb wire was \nplaced to stop people from fleeing but that did not stop 19-year-old border guard Hans Conrad Schumann. A crown in \nWest Berlin was enticing the young soldier to come over. The soldier said he did not want to \"live enclosed,\" and jumped \nthe barbed wire, escaping into the West side. The photo was considered a symbol of freedom but Hans did not deal with \nthe newly-found fame well — he committed suicide in 1998. \n#26 'D-Day' \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020692 \nImage source: TIME \nLIFE photographer Robert Capa captured this dramatic image on 6 June, 1944 — during the D-Day invasion. The man in \nthe photo is Private First Class Huston Riley, a 22-year-old soldier who was shot multiple times. The photographer and a \nfellow sergeant helped the wounded soldier who later recalled thinking \"What the hell is this guy doing here? I can't \nbelieve it. Here's a cameraman on the shore.\" Robert spent over an hour taking photographs as men around him died. \nSadly, only one roll of the film survived but the grainy photos were enough to portray the gut-wrenching atmosphere of \nthat day. \n#27 An Injured Young Mill Worker \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020693 \nThis photo, captured in October 1912, shows an 11-year-old Sanders Spinning Mill worker Giles Edmund Newsom, who \nrecently lost two fingers after an accident in the workplace. He was working along his younger brother for a few months \nbefore the accident. \n*28 Rodney Alcala \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020694 \nIn this picture, Rodney Alcala, known as the 'dating game killer', cross-examines himself in court. He killed several \nwomen in the 705 and was even a guest on a dating show during that period. He tried representing himself in court, \nchanging his voice and pretending to be a different person, but eventually lost and was sentenced to death. \n*29 \"The Last Laugh?\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020695 \nTwo convicted murderers — Richard Hickock and Perry Smith — laugh after hearing about their death sentences.

Strassel \nMay 10, 2018 6:50 p.m. ET \n1663 COMMENTS \n• \n• \n• \n• • The Department of Justice lost its latest battle with Congress Thursday when it agreed to brief House \nIntelligence Committee members about a top-secret intelligence source that was part of the FBI's \ninvestigation of the Trump campaign. Even without official confirmation of that source's name, the news so \nfar holds some stunning implications. \nAmong them is that the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation outright hid critical \ninformation from a congressional investigation. In a Thursday press conference, Speaker Paul Ryan bluntly \nnoted that Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes's request for details on this secret source was \"wholly \nappropriate,\" \"completely within the scope\" of the committee's long-running FBI investigation, and \n\"something that probably should have been answered a while ago.\" Translation: The department knew full \nwell it should have turned this material over to congressional investigators last year, but instead deliberately \nconcealed it. \nHouse investigators nonetheless sniffed out a name, and Mr. Nunes in recent weeks issued a letter and a \nsubpoena demanding more details. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's response was to double \ndown—accusing the House of \"extortion\" and delivering a speech in which he claimed that \"declining to \nopen the FBI's files to review\" is a constitutional \"duty.\" Justice asked the White House to back its \nstonewall. And it even began spinning that daddy of all superspook arguments—that revealing any detail \nabout this particular asset could result in \"loss of human lives.\" \nThis is desperation, and it strongly suggests that whatever is in these files is going to prove very \nuncomfortable to the FBI. \nThe bureau already has some explaining to do. Thanks to the Washington Post's unnamed law-enforcement \nleakers, we know Mr. Nunes's request deals with a \"top secret intelligence source\" of the FBI and CIA, who \nis a U.S. citizen and who was involved in the Russia collusion probe. When government agencies refer to \nsources, they mean people who appear to be average citizens but use their profession or contacts to spy for \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020819 \nthe agency. Ergo, we might take this to mean that the FBI secretly had a person on the payroll who used his \nor her non-FBI credentials to interact in some capacity with the Trump campaign. \nThis would amount to spying, and it is hugely disconcerting. It would also be a major escalation from the \nelectronic surveillance we already knew about, which was bad enough. Obama political appointees \nrampantly \"unmasked\" Trump campaign officials to monitor their conversations, while the FBI played dirty \nwith its surveillance warrant against Carter Page, failing to tell the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \nthat its supporting information came from the Hillary Clinton campaign. Now we find it may have also been \nrolling out human intelligence, John Le Carr& style, to infiltrate the Trump campaign. \nWhich would lead to another big question for the FBI: When? The bureau has been doggedly sticking with \nits story that a tip in July 2016 about the drunken ramblings of George Papadopoulos launched its \ncounterintelligence probe. Still, the players in this affair—the FBI, former Director Jim Comey, the Steele \ndossier authors—have been suspiciously vague on the key moments leading up to that launch date. When \nprecisely was the Steele dossier delivered to the FBI? When precisely did the Papadopoulos information \ncome in? \nAnd to the point, when precisely was this human source operating? Because if it was prior to that infamous \nPapadopoulos tip, then the FBI isn't being straight. It would mean the bureau was spying on the Trump \ncampaign prior to that moment. And that in turn would mean that the FBI had been spurred to act on the \nbasis of something other than a junior campaign aide's loose lips. \nWe also know that among the Justice Department's stated reasons for not complying with the Nunes \nsubpoena was its worry that to do so might damage international relationships. This suggests the \"source\" \nmay be overseas, have ties to foreign intelligence, or both. That's notable, given the highly suspicious role \nforeigners have played in this escapade. It was an Australian diplomat who reported the Papadopoulos \nconversation. Dossier author Christopher Steele is British, used to work for MI6, and retains ties to that spy \nagency as well as to a network of former spooks. It was a former British diplomat who tipped off Sen. John \nMcCain to the dossier. How this \"top secret\" source fits into this puzzle could matter deeply. \nI believe I know the name of the informant, but my intelligence sources did not provide it to me and refuse to \nconfirm it. It would therefore be irresponsible to publish it. But what is clear is that we've barely scratched \nthe surface of the FBI's 2016 behavior, and the country will never get the straight story until President \nTrump moves to declassify everything possible. It's time to rip off the Band-Aid. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 020820 \nCorrection \nThe FBI briefed House Intelligence Committee members about a top-secret intelligence source but did not \nallow them to see documents.

She has written for publications \nincluding the New York Times, New York magazine, the New York Observer, and the Wall Street Journal, \nwhere she wrote design and lifestyle features for the Weekend Journal section. Before that, she was a reporter \nat the New York Observer. She is currently working on a book called American Coddle, about America's \nculture of entitlement. \nX Close \nNo, back then Epstein was mid-makeover. He had monarchy in-house and famous faces at his table. Former \nBear Stearns CEO James Cayne had just endorsed Epstein on his science foundation's website (which has been \nsince removed). It seemed Epstein had joined the ranks of former President Clinton, director Roman Polanski, \nand former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer, whose sex scandals faded in comparison with their celebrity. \nThe conventional wisdom among his friends was that Epstein has been victimized by greedy, morally dubious \nteenage girls and unscrupulous lawyers. \"I've never condoned paying for sex, but if the young lady lied about \nher age it's her own fault,\" explained one socialite, who along with hedge-fund manager Wilbur Ross and real-\nestate magnate Leon Black hobnobbed with Epstein at a Southampton movie screening just two months after \nhis release from \"community control\" in Florida. \nMuch of Epstein's entrée into New York society can be credited to Ghislaine Maxwell, the superbly well-\nconnected daughter of the late press magnate Robert Maxwell. Epstein started dating her in the 1990s. The \nromantic relationship ended after a few years, but they have remained close ever since. Last week two victims \npublicly alleged that Ghislaine procured them for Epstein, one at age 15 from a Mar-a-Lago country club locker \nroom. Virginia Roberts, now 27, who was Epstein's sexual plaything for several years, told the Mail on \nSunday. \"Ghislaine sent me to a dentist to have my teeth whitened and I went for Brazilian waxes. He wanted \nme to look pre-pubescent.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021090 \nNow, New York friends are suddenly hesitant to talk about Maxwell. \"She's a high-end 'fixer',\" and so what? \nthey ask. \"No one in café society gives a damn that a 15-year-old girl gives massages,\" says one frequent \ncharity-benefit guest. \"She gets people into parties and runs around for a lot of people.\" As to the fallout from \nher association with Epstein, he says, \"If you're Mike Huckabee it would matter but not if you're Ghislaine \nMaxwell.\" \nThe crowd at the events top publicist Peggy Siegal has organized for Epstein proves the point, at least behind \nclosed doors. \"I and many others that know him describe him as brilliant,\" says Siegal. \"His unique mind is \nwhat attracts the world's smartest people to his home.\" Last September, with Siegal's help, Epstein hosted a \nBreak Fast after Yom Kippur. A group of 120 friends brought their children over for a buffet dinner. One \nattendee, Jonathan Farkas, a New York real-estate heir, has known Epstein for 35 years and visited him while \nhe was in prison. \"The side I've been reading about is a side I don't know,\" he says. Farkas considers Epstein \none of the smartest people he knows and often asks him for investment advice. \"Unless I've seen it, I don't focus \non it,\" he says. \n\"From a cerebral and business side he's worshipped,\" says socialite Debbie Bancroft. \"He's incredibly \ncharming and handsome. He's an extraordinary package so I can see why people don't want to believe what \nthey hear. If people come out of jail and are still successful, people are very forgiving, shockingly so.\" \nRenowned scientists whose research Epstein has generously funded through the years also stand by him. \nProfessor Lawrence Krauss, a theoretical physicist and author of Quantum Man, has planned scientific \nconferences with Epstein in St. Thomas and remained close with him throughout his incarceration. \"If \nanything, the unfortunate period he suffered has caused him to really think about what he wants to do with his \nmoney and his time, and support knowledge,\" says Krauss. \"Jeffrey has surrounded himself with beautiful \nwomen and young women but they're not as young as the ones that were claimed. As a scientist I always judge \nthings on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've never seen anything \nelse, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would believe him over other \npeople.\" Though colleagues have criticized him over his relationship with Epstein, Krauss insists, \"I don't feel \ntarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it.\" \nAlexandra Wolfe is a former contributing editor to Conde Nast Portfolio.

Once again, a reminder to send me your delicious scoops \nand tips at kiaPaxios.com or find me on Twitter at Pimkialikethecar. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021096 \nHot event alert: RSVP to our 2/26 event in NYC for interviews with NBA star \nDraymond Green, BBG Ventures' Susan Lyne, JPMorgan's Jennifer Piepszak, and \nEquinox CEO Harvey Spevak. \nTop of the Morning \nIllustration: Rebecca Zisser / Axios \nAT&T's proposed $85 billion purchase of Time Warner took another turn yesterday. A \nfederal judge hearing the Justice Department's lawsuit to block the deal denied a \nrequest by the telecom giant to disclose communications between Justice Department \nofficials, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and the White House about the \ndeal. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021097 \n• Why it matters: The ruling is a blow to AT&T's attempt to show that the \nlawsuit to block the deal is politically motivated by President Trump's antipathy for \nCNN, which Time Warner owns. AT&T says it wasn't asked to offload any assets as \npart of the deal until after Trump took office. \n• What they're saying: \"We respect the judge's decision and look forward to \nthe upcoming trial,\" said Dan Petrocelli, who is leading AT&T and Time Warner's \ndefense in the case, in a statement. \n• At a hearing on Friday, a Justice Department lawyer said that AT&T's \nargument for the documents \"didn't make sense.\" \n• Go deeper: Our report from the courtroom on Friday, when DOJ and AT&T \npresented their arguments. \nFund scoop: Niv Dror, who joined AngelList through its acquisition of Product Hunt \nin 2016, is raising a small early-stage fund focused on consumer products, multiple \nsources tell Axios. Dror declined to comment. \n• The fund will raise at least $1 million, though one source says it could go up to \n$2-3 million. \n• Like Product Hunt colleague Ryan Hoover's own VC fund, Dror's will be \nmanaged on the back-end by AngelList. \nSame old story: Yesterday, I grabbed coffee with Day One Ventures founder Masha \nDrokova, and heard a familiar—and still disappointing—story: While raising her fund, \nshe was told by prospective investors that she should get a male co-founder. \n• She initially considered the suggestion, she told me, before remembering it's \nrooted in sexism. \nSoftbank $$$: Softbank's Vision Fund is in early talks to raise additional funds from \nBahrain's sovereign wealth fund, Mumtalakat, the latter's CEO told Reuters. \n• The Persian Gulf has been a major source of funds for the Vision Fund: Public \nInvestment Fund, Saudi Arabia's main sovereign wealth fund, and Abu Dhabi's \nMubadala, are already investors. \n• And it's not the only one visiting the region's investors—funds focused on tokens \nand cryptocurrencies have also been fundraising in the area, I'm told. \nUnicorn stampede: We're not even two months into 2018 and yet, seven startups \nhave already seen their private valuations cross the $1 billion mark—earning \"unicorn\" \nstatus—according to Pitchbook. Last year: 53. The word \"overvalued\" comes to mind... \n1-:77-3:7A \n1-:77-3:7A \n1-:77-3:7A \nThe BFD \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021098 \nPhoto: George Rose/Getty Images \nBroadcom has adjusted its takeover offer for Qualcomm to $79 per share, down from \nthe its \"best and final\" bid of $82. The move is a response to Qualcomm's \nannouncement yesterday it would pay $127.50 a share for NXP, up from the $ilo it \nhad offered. \n• Why it's the BFD: Broadcom and Qualcomm's takeover dance has taken a \ndramatic turn for what should have been a boring transaction between two chip \ncompanies. \n• Bottom line: \"Broadcom has long said its acquisition of the San Diego-based \nchipmaker is contingent on Qualcomm buying NXP at the previously agreed price, \nsaving a large amount of cash Broadcom could hypothetically use for its own purposes \nonce the acquisition goes through... Qualcomm raised its NXP bid to secure support \nfrom activist investors who have piled into NXP and demanded a higher sale price.\" — \nBloomberg. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021099 \nViva!, \nViva!, \nVenture Capital Deals \n• Moovit, an Israeli maker of a transportation app, has raised $50 million in Series D \nfunding led by Intel Capital, with participation from Sequoia, BMW iVentures, NGP, \nSound Ventures, BRM, Gemini, Vaizra, Vintage, and Hanaco. http://axioslink/fQSW \n• Vectra, a San Jose, Calif.-based cybersecurity startup, has raised $36 million in \nSeries D funding led by Atlantic Bridge, with participation from the Ireland \nStrategic Investment Fund, Nissho Electronics Corp., Khosla Ventures, Accel Partners, \nIA Ventures, AME Cloud Ventures, DAG Ventures and Wipro Ventures. www.vectra.ai  \n• FourKites, a Chicago-based make of supply chain management software, has raised \n$35 million in Series B funding.

PHOTO: JOSHUA ROBERTS/REUTERS \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021109 \nBy \nKimberley A. Strassel \nMay 10, 2018 6:50 p.m. ET \n1663 COMMENTS \nThe Department of Justice lost its latest battle with Congress Thursday when it agreed to brief House \nIntelligence Committee members about a top-secret intelligence source that was part of the FBI's \ninvestigation of the Trump campaign. Even without official confirmation of that source's name, the news so \nfar holds some stunning implications. \nAmong them is that the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation outright hid critical \ninformation from a congressional investigation. In a Thursday press conference, Speaker Paul Ryan bluntly \nnoted that Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes's request for details on this secret source was \"wholly \nappropriate,\" \"completely within the scope\" of the committee's long-running FBI investigation, and \n\"something that probably should have been answered a while ago.\" Translation: The department knew full \nwell it should have turned this material over to congressional investigators last year, but instead deliberately \nconcealed it. \nHouse investigators nonetheless sniffed out a name, and Mr. Nunes in recent weeks issued a letter and a \nsubpoena demanding more details. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's response was to double \ndown—accusing the House of \"extortion\" and delivering a speech in which he claimed that \"declining to \nopen the FBI's files to review\" is a constitutional \"duty.\" Justice asked the White House to back its \nstonewall. And it even began spinning that daddy of all superspook arguments—that revealing any detail \nabout this particular asset could result in \"loss of human lives.\" \nThis is desperation, and it strongly suggests that whatever is in these files is going to prove very \nuncomfortable to the FBI. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021110 \nThe bureau already has some explaining to do. Thanks to the Washington Post's unnamed law-enforcement \nleakers, we know Mr. Nunes's request deals with a \"top secret intelligence source\" of the FBI and CIA, \nwho is a U.S. citizen and who was involved in the Russia collusion probe. When government agencies refer \nto sources, they mean people who appear to be average citizens but use their profession or contacts to spy \nfor the agency. Ergo, we might take this to mean that the FBI secretly had a person on the payroll who used \nhis or her non-FBI credentials to interact in some capacity with the Trump campaign. \nThis would amount to spying, and it is hugely disconcerting. It would also be a major escalation from the \nelectronic surveillance we already knew about, which was bad enough. Obama political appointees \nrampantly \"unmasked\" Trump campaign officials to monitor their conversations, while the FBI played dirty \nwith its surveillance warrant against Carter Page, failing to tell the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \nthat its supporting information came from the Hillary Clinton campaign. Now we find it may have also been \nrolling out human intelligence, John Le Carr& style, to infiltrate the Trump campaign. \nWhich would lead to another big question for the FBI: When? The bureau has been doggedly sticking with \nits story that a tip in July 2016 about the drunken ramblings of George Papadopoulos launched its \ncounterintelligence probe. Still, the players in this affair—the FBI, former Director Jim Comey, the Steele \ndossier authors—have been suspiciously vague on the key moments leading up to that launch date. When \nprecisely was the Steele dossier delivered to the FBI? When precisely did the Papadopoulos information \ncome in? \nAnd to the point, when precisely was this human source operating? Because if it was prior to that infamous \nPapadopoulos tip, then the FBI isn't being straight. It would mean the bureau was spying on the Trump \ncampaign prior to that moment. And that in turn would mean that the FBI had been spurred to act on the \nbasis of something other than a junior campaign aide's loose lips. \nWe also know that among the Justice Department's stated reasons for not complying with the Nunes \nsubpoena was its worry that to do so might damage international relationships. This suggests the \"source\" \nmay be overseas, have ties to foreign intelligence, or both. That's notable, given the highly suspicious role \nforeigners have played in this escapade. It was an Australian diplomat who reported the Papadopoulos \nconversation. Dossier author Christopher Steele is British, used to work for MI6, and retains ties to that spy \nagency as well as to a network of former spooks. It was a former British diplomat who tipped off Sen. John \nMcCain to the dossier. How this \"top secret\" source fits into this puzzle could matter deeply. \nI believe I know the name of the informant, but my intelligence sources did not provide it to me and refuse \nto confirm it. It would therefore be irresponsible to publish it. But what is clear is that we've barely \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021111 \nscratched the surface of the FBI's 2016 behavior, and the country will never get the straight story until \nPresident Trump moves to declassify everything possible.

And as wretched as the \nU.S. economy seems, its not as bad as in other regions. \nThe International Monetary Fund's latest tally of world economic conditions forecasts a 2.6 decline in U.S. economic output for all of \n2009, and anemic growth of 0.8 percent in 2010. That's more optimistic than the IMF's prediction from three months ago, but those \nare still lousy numbers. A weak economy throughout 2010 would mean a bleak employment picture, an agonizingly slow housing \nrecovery, and another year or two likely to feel like a recession, whether its technically labeled that or not. \nWe should count ourselves lucky, though. The IMF expects at least 11 major parts of the world to have more severe economic \ncontractions than the United State this year, including most of western Europe, Japan, Russia, and Mexico. Europe will still be \nstumbling along behind the United States next year, as well. Here are the IMF's projections for economic growth in various parts of \nthe world: \n2009. 2010 \nChina. \t7.5. \t8.5 \nIndia. \t5.4 \t6.5 \nMiddle East 2.0 \t3.7 \nAfrica. 1.8 4.7 \nBrazil. -1.3 2.5 \nWorld total -1.4 2.5 \nCanada. \t-2.3 \t1.6 \nU.S. \t-2.6 \t0.8 \nFrance. \t-3.0 \t0.4 \nSpain. \t-4.0 \t-0.8 \nU.K. \t-4.2 \t0.2 \nE U. \t-4.7 \t-0.1 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021231 \nE Europe. -5.0 1.0 \nItaly. \t-5.1 \t-0.1 \nJapan. \t-6.0 \t1.7 \nGermany. \t-6.2 \t-0.6 \nRussia. \t-6.5 \t1.5 \nMexico. \t-7.3 \t3.0 \nIf these projections come true, it means the United States, despite its overspent consumers, wrecked banks, and insolvent auto \nmakers, will be leading the world economy out of recession. Somehow. The developing world will help, but those high growth \nprojections in China and India can be deceiving. \nChina in particular has government policies that practically mandate high growth, and 8.5 percent in 2010 would be just about the \nbare minimum to keep employment at tolerable levels. And neither China nor India is a major buyer of American-made goods and \nservices; for the most part, its the other way around. With much of the developed world trailing the United States, it will take \nAmerican consumers to ratchet up demand for the world's products. Scary thought. \nHow to tell when a real recovery begins.? \n4 Ways to Tell When a Real Recovery Has Begun \nYou could conclude just about anything from the daily cavalcade of economic statistics. Some suggest an imminent recovery. Others \nseem to foretell years of gloom. The bent of the expert interpreting the latest news—bull, bear, Obama-basher, Wall Street-hater—\nhas as much to do with the outlook as the numbers themselves. \nFor the foreseeable future, there will be an aggressive hunt for two economic recoveries. One is the technical improvement in \neconomic indicators that signals the economy is growing again. That's the one economists care about, which is why they scour the \nnumbers on retail sales, business inventories, purchasing manager sentiment, subatomic inflation, the mood in Shanghai, and \nanything else that could help pinpoint the exact inflection point for a turnaround. \nThe other recovery, the one that most consumers are waiting for, is the one in which companies stop firing and start hiring, banks \nreturn to normal lending, and families stop worrying about jobs and income. And that turnaround—the consumer recovery—is likely \nto take much longer to materialize than the technical recovery. \nThe danger of hyping a technical recovery is that it will arrive, with much fanfare—but fail to make ordinary consumers feel better \noff. Many economists, for example, are predicting that the recession will officially end by this summer or fall. The only problem is \nthat when a technical recovery begins, a lot of companies fail to get the memo. They don't play along; they keep payrolls lean and \nmaybe even continuing to lay off workers. So to guard against false optimism, here's how to tell when a real recovery is finally \nkicking into gear: \nUnemployment improves. The single best indicator of the health of the economy is the job market. People who have lost their job, or \nworry that they might, obviously hoard their money and don't spend. That spells doom for an economy driven by consumer spending, \nas ours is. But once its clear that jobs are coming back, consumers are more likely to relax and open their wallets. \nProjections about unemployment should make anybody queasy about the prospects for a recovery this year. The unemployment rate \nis currently 9.4 percent, a steep rise from one year ago, when it was an unremarkable 5.5 percent. And by most accounts, its going to \nget worse. The International Monetary Fund expects the U.S. unemployment rate to be 10.1 percent in 2010. Economist Gary \nShilling thinks unemployment will hit 11.4 percent and not peak until late next year. \nIts hard to imagine a \"recovery\" in which jobs are even more scarce than they are now. When the unemployment rate finally starts to \ngo in the other direction, we can start to think about putting the umbrellas away. Until then, no number of upticks or volume of \noptimistic talk will persuade Americans worried about their jobs that they should part with precious cash. \nHousing prices stabilize. This has become a mantra by now: For the economy to get healthy, housing prices must stop falling. \nProblem is, the houses haven't been listening. \nHousing matters for two reasons: It represents a big chunk of the economy, and its the largest single repository of Americans' \nhousehold wealth. With prices falling, buyers are scarce, since nobody wants to buy an expensive good today if its going to be worth \nless tomorrow. With few buyers, all the other economic activity that swirls around real estate—remodeling, appliance and furniture \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021232 \nsales, relocation services—is depressed. Homeowners are worse off, too, because the value of one of their vital assets is eroding. \nHouse prices have already fallen by 32 percent nationwide from the 2006 peak. And they have further to go. The latest readings on \nthe S&P/Case-Schiller home price index, one prominent measure, showed another record decline in May. At some point, the declines \nwill moderate and stop being records. But prices need to stop falling altogether, and probably rise, for a real recovery to happen. The \nFederal Reserve thinks home prices could stop falling in 2010, after a total decline of 41 to 48 percent. Other metrics, like housing \nstarts and new-home sales, might point upward before then. Those will be signs of signs of a turnaround, not the real thing. \nHousehold wealth increases. The housing bust and the volatile stock market have hammered the traditional investment tools that \nmost Americans use, causing epic declines in the wealth of Americans. Since 2006, household net worth has declined by about $12 \ntrillion, which equates to about $107,000 of lost wealth for each of America's 112 million households. That's partly because of the 40 \npercent plunge in the stock market since October 2007 and partly because of the steep declines in real estate values. \nAmericans simply own less, too. Home equity for the typical homeowner is just 41.1 percent, a record low. In 2002, it was 58.4 \npercent. Owning less means we owe more and will have to rebuild savings before we can spend like we used to. \"This will be a drag \non all discretionary purchases,\" says Dirk van Dijk, an analyst at Zacks Investment Research who thinks the tightfistedness will cut \ninto the earnings of firms ranging from hotel chains to furniture makers to motorcycle manufacturers. Those are the same kinds of \ncompanies that need to start hiring again for a real recovery to develop. But they won't if sales stay sluggish. A turnaround will \nrequire sustained stock market gains and an end to the housing bust. \nPresident Obama stops fudging on the economy. There's still a lot that could go wrong, and Obama knows it. Yet part of the \npresident's job is to reassure skittish Americans, even as his economic lieutenants are fighting battles in the war room. That's why \nObama has been making half-hearted pronouncements, like saying that the economy shows \"some return to normalcy\" and that \"we \nexpect there'll be some stabilization of the economy.\" Virtually all of Obama's remarks on the economy contain modifiers and future \ntense and a not-quite-there-yet quality, since hell blow his own credibility if he tries to convince Americans that they're better off \nthan they actually are. When Obama starts hedging less, be happy. That will signal better days. Finally. \nThe IMF does offer a bit of more heartening news: The global wipe out finally seems to be receding. \"The world economy is \nstabilizing,\" the IMF reports. Its global economic growth projection of 2.5 percent in 2010 is 0.6 points higher than predicted in \nApril. But the global economy isn't expected to gain its footing in earnest until the second half of 2010. Maybe by then American \nspenders will have come out of hiding. \nObama says stimulus plan to kick in later this year Reuters \nObama says stimulus plan to kick in later this year \nBy Tom Doggett — Sat Jul 11, 3:13 pm ET \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) — President Barack Obama said Saturday more time was needed for his $787 billion stimulus package to \nwork, predicting the spending would have a bigger impact on the economy later this year. \nIn an advanced text of his weekly radio speech, Obama said the stimulus plan approved by Congress and signed into law in mid-\nFebruary \"was not designed to work in four months -- it was designed to work over two years.\" \nU.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said it was too soon to decide whether the U.S. economy needed the help of a second-\nround of government stimulus to recover from recession. \n\"I don't think that's a judgment we need to make now, can't really make it now prudently, responsibly,\" he said in a taped interview \nwith CNN that will air Sunday. \nAccording to a transcript provided by CNN, Geithner said the \"biggest thrust\" of the stimulus package signed into law earlier this \nyear would take effect in the second half of the year. \nObama's comments follow government data showing the unemployment rate soared to 9.5 percent in June, the highest level since \n1983 and above the 8 percent peak predicted by the White House when it worked with Congress to pass the package. Republicans \nsay the stimulus plan is not working. \nObama now warns unemployment likely will top 10 percent in the coming months. \n\"We must let (the stimulus plan) work the way its supposed to, with the understanding that in any recession, unemployment tends to \nrecover more slowly than other measures of economic activity,\" Obama said. \nHe said the benefits of the plan would \"accelerate greatly throughout the summer and the fall.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021233 \nThe continuing recession and further steep job losses are wearing away the patience of Americans and raising doubts about Obama's \nhandling of the economy. \nThe share of Americans who believe the stimulus package will restore the economy slipped to 52 percent in late June, down from 59 \npercent two months earlier, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. \nVice President Joe Biden said the administration had \"misread\" how bad the economy was when it took office but that the stimulus \npackage would help the economy recovery and create jobs. \nSenate Republican Leader Mich McConnell Friday called the stimulus plan a failure. \nObama said it takes time for the plan's money \"to get out the door\" to pay for roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects that will \ncreate jobs \"because we are committed to spending it in a way that is effective and transparent.\" \n********************************************DIscLAImER*********************************** \n********* \nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and contain privileged or \ncopyright \ninformation.

Thought it would amuse you. Tell me what you \nthink of it. \nxoxo Peggy \nHD: Wall Street, Take Two \nDEK: In the upcoming sequel to Oliver Stone's groundbreaking film, Gordon Gekko gets out of jail and back \nto business. Peggy Siegal takes us behind the scenes where she got herself on camera along with a few of her \nfamous friends. Nice work if you can get it. \nIn 1987, right after director Oliver Stone won the Academy Award for \"Platoon,\" he immediately turned to a \ndomestic arena and began working on \"Wall Street\" in New York City where his father had been a \nstockbroker. Although the film was widely seen as a scathing critique of the culture of Wall Street, Stone has \nsaid that part of the film is a defense of capitalism, his father's vision of finance (as seen through the Hal \nHolbrook character) and an homage to his father. \nAt the time Oliver was also fascinated with the connection between the psyche of Latino Miami drug dealers \nfrom his earlier \"Scarface\" script and the American-born 28- to 35-year-old, white collar stockbrokers. Both \ngroups had an animalistic need to obtain big and fast money. They shared an obsession with corruption and \ngreed. \nOliver sent his actors to Bear Stearns for research, including then-newcomer Charlie Sheen, who played Bud \nFox, a kid from nowhere. When he learns to cold call, and lands one big client, Gordon Gekko, Fox is thrust \ninto the fast lane with a rock star financial mentor who teaches him corruption. \nOliver needed an old-fashioned villain to create drama, and he cast Michael Douglas as Gekko against type. \nMichael was not known as a heavy at the time, but as a charming, handsome, sensitive leading man. Oliver \nalso saw the anger, confidence, salesmanship and style that Michael brought to the role. Michael's Gekko \nlooked a bit like Laker's coach Pat Riley with his slicked back hair and well-cut suits, and it became Michael's \nmost important role, winning him the Academy Award for the villain no one could ever forget. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021235 \nWhen Gekko delivers his speech, \"Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works,\" \ncinematic history was made. \n\"Wall Street\" was set in 1985, a time before ten financial news networks broadcasting 24/7 existed. The entire \nfinancial services industry was largely unknown and Oliver Stone nailed it. \nFour years ago, Wall Street's producer Ed Pressman decided it was time for a sequel and met with Fox Film \nEntertainment co-chairmen Tom Rothman and Jim Gianopulos. Michael Douglas was immediately on-board \npending script approval. Steven Schiff wrote the first script before the global economic crash of 2008 rendered \nit obsolete. \nAlan Loeb was brought in for a rewrite. Pressman asked me to meet Loeb at the Carlyle Hotel to explain the \nsocial rhythms of New York's financial high society. Whereas Gekko's character was modeled after '70s junk \nbond kings (Michael Milken) and '80s mergers and acquisitions killers (Henry Kravis), Loeb bases the new \nvillain on hedge fund billionaires like John Paulson and Mike Novogratz, geniuses who have created \nstratospheric wealth beyond Gordon Gekko's wildest dreams. When Oliver Stone agreed to direct, he rewrote a \nportion of the script to focus on bankers as well as hedge funders, taking no screen credit. \nThis past September, Oliver yelled, \"action\" as Gordon Gekko, with long grey hair, comes back to life as he \nemerges from a lengthy prison stint shot outside of Sing Sing in Ossining, New York. Gekko is desperate to \nredefine himself in a different era. The New York Post runs a full-page photo of Gekko and New Yorkers \nimmediately become obsessed with the filming of Wall Street 2. \nA week into shooting, a glorious fall day. Ed Pressman invites me on the set at the Central Park Zoo. Oliver \ndesigns an elaborate tracking shot around the seal pool where Gekko, fresh from jail, walks and talks to Jake \nMoore, a young idealistic investment banker played by Shia LaBoeuf. They discuss Gekko's daughter Winnie, \nMoore's fiancée, played by Carrie Mulligan, who is also having an off-screen romance with LaBoeuf. Oliver \nplayed Cupid. Moore invites Gekko to the Alzheimer's Ball at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Gekko, who \nused to be a sponsor or honoree of such events, cannot even afford a ticket. \nThe shot starts with a barking seal jumping for fish, then pans down to the actors. Extras weave in and out. In \none take Michael makes a wrong turn and ends up at the monkey house. Everyone laughs. The atmosphere on \nthe set is courteous but quick and tense. There is pressure when you are making a sequel to a hit. \nI watch the action on monitors while sitting on the producers' canvas chairs with Pressman, Eric Kopeloff \n(\"Monsters Ball\") and Celia Costas, who was a location manager on the first \"Wall Street.\" They have asked \nme to be an extra in the Alzheimer's Ball scene and bring some friends to play rich Upper East Side socialites. \nOliver wants over the top glam, go-to-the-vault jewels and couture gowns. \"Give me the night before the \nTitanic goes down,\" were his exact words. Not a problem. \nI pay a quick visit to Michael in his trailer on Fifth Avenue where he is resting. We go way back. I was his \npersonal publicist when he won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Best Actor for \"Wall Street\" and we have \nremained great friends. Gekko is just as challenging for him the second time because of endless pages of \ntechnical financial dialogue. We discuss Catherine Zeta-Jones' Broadway debut in a \"Little Night Music.\" \nMichael has a stack of partially finished handwritten thank you notes next to him for gifts received for \ntheir shared birthday party on September 25th at the St. Regis. Her 40th and his 65th. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021236 \nI tell him I have been cast as an extra in two scenes and he laughs knowing I am desperate to hang around him \nand the production. \n8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 21st, another warm, stunning fall day. I report to the wardrobe trailer on \n65th Street and Madison Avenue. I carry four elaborate cocktail dresses and bags of matching accessories. My \nhair is in rollers. Statuesque Julia Koch walks over from her Park Avenue apartment carrying her white \nValentino and long diamond earrings. Her real-life financial titan husband David is unaware where she is this \nmorning. \nVanity Fair's keeper of the Best Dressed List, Amy Fine Collins, arrives totally organized in turquoise vintage \nGeoffrey Beene, and Vogue's fashion editor Hamish Bowles wears a riot of plaids, patterns and a large yellow \nfake flower on his lapel. Costume Designer Ellen Mirojnick, who created Gordon Gekko's rich slick look in the \nfirst film, is ecstatic with the extras I invited. \nOliver is shooting a scene with Josh Brolin (the star of Stone's \"W\"). His character Bretton (never Bret) \nJames, a ruthless Wall Street kingpin, and his perfect wife Samantha (Noelle Beck) are hosting a benefit piano \nrecital for a 13-year-old child prodigy in their huge, art-filled townhouse at 41 East 65th Street. The building \nactually belongs to Baby Jane Holzer, a wealthy art collector still famous for hanging with Andy Warhol in the \n'60s. The production designer had Jane's fabulous Warhols moved to storage and replaced with matching \nphotographic copies. Very expensive contemporary art is again an important production element of Oliver's \nvision. \nAt 10:30 a.m., all the extras are placed around the living room set. Oliver's French mother, Jacqueline Stone, \nand her friend Monique Van Vooren, both in their 80s, are seated in front of the fireplace chatting in French. \nProduction assistants fuss over them. Debonair macho man Chuck Pfieffer, who appeared in the original film, \nand I immediately invent a back story—I am his corporate wife—and we position ourselves on a couch next to \nthe director's mother. Julia gets the best spot close to the piano and Amy, Hamish and decorator Geoffrey \nBradfield are right behind her. Josh is brought in and the kibitzing stops. \nOliver appears on the set with eagle eyes and a sly grin and quickly re-positions everyone. He explains the \nscene, gives out lines to his favored extras, and on his way out to the monitors in the next room mentions that \nmy earrings are too small. Wardrobe jumps. Josh rehearses and Oliver finally yells, \"Action.\" The kid plays \nthe piano, Josh explains why we are in his home, asks for money, the camera dollies as extras say their lines \nand Shia appears at the door uninvited for a confrontation with Josh. Three hours later a PA yells, \"Lunch\". \nIn costume, Amy, Hamish and I run to The Monkey Bar. I am late to meet \"The Harpies,\" including Liz \nSmith, Barbara Walters, Cynthia McFadden, Nora Ephron, Jennifer Isham, Maury Perl and Beth Kseniak. \nGraydon Carter is at the next table. I tell him Oliver Stone wants him in \"Wall Street 2\" as an extra. (I make \nthis up.) Graydon jokes that he only works with lines. I say, \"Not a problem.\" (This will be news to Oliver.) \nBack on the set I tell Oliver that Graydon is willing to be in the film with lines. Oliver finds that intriguing. \nOliver shoots the piano recital scene over and over again from different angles all afternoon. Financial wizard \nDon Marron saunters on the set to visit and Oliver spontaneously puts him in a scene chatting with Josh. Carrie \nMulligan hangs out watching boyfriend Shia work. \nAt sundown Julia Koch has to race from reel to real life and explain to her husband where she has been all day. \n(He loves it.) \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021237 \nChuck Pfieffer plants a \"Page Six\" item and the next day socialites begin calling me to get into the film. \nThursday, November 5, Shun Lee Restaurant, West 65th Street \nOliver shoots a crowded tight interior scene with Michael, Carrie and Shia, who are having an intimate \nChinese dinner. Spontaneously, Oliver decides this is the perfect scene for Graydon Carter. After a flurry of \ncalls, Graydon arrives on set, and playing himself, sashays by the table. Gekko jumps up to say hello and \nGraydon brushes him off with a few dismissive lines. \nMonday, November 9, 25 Broadway \nOne hundred swells show up at the former Canard Shipping building, a massive Italianate hall, at the crack of \ndawn for the Alzheimer's Ball, a grand charity event. \nSusan Hess and I are chauffeured downtown with our Vera Wang gowns and report to the VIP extra holding \narea where we join Prince Dimitri of Yugoslavia in a bespoke dinner jacket, journalist Christopher Mason, \nsongstress Yanna Avis, photographer Kelly Klein, art dealer Larry Gagosian's girl friend Shala Monroque in \nsee-through Rodarte, beauty executive Olivia Chantecaille, producer Lawrence Robins, author Jackie Weld \nDrake, Vogue film critic Joan Juliet Buck, fashion consultant Jill Fairchild, CNN's Felicia Taylor and Italian \nnewsman Mario Calvo-Platero. \nEllen Mirojnick and her costume department have assembled racks of the most expensive elaborate designer \ngowns and work at break neck speed styling while we wildly strip to our undies in a makeshift dressing area. \nEllen pours me into a black tulle Marchesa with a enormous wired silver bow. Twenty hairdressers and make-\nup artists systematically work on 250 extras. A mile of tables are alternately filled with steaming coffee, \nfattening breakfast foods, hair sprays, mirrors, shoes and jewelry. It's a madhouse of excitement. \nWe are led to the part of the set used for the cocktail reception and placed around Michael Douglas and Charlie \nSheen stand-ins. Charlie has been flown in from LA for half a day's work to reprise his original character. He \nis now the highest paid television actor commanding two million dollars an episode of \"Two and a Half Men.\" \nOliver arrives on the set greeting, examining, tweaking the shot and always pulling the prettiest girls closest to \nthe camera. Michael and Charlie arrive from their trailers and run their lines as socials drift into their sight \nlines challenging their concentration on pages of dialogue. Oliver yells, \"Action\" as the extras aggressively \njockey for face time. Charlie is not having an easy day and they do take after take. My corporate husband \nChuck Pfieffer has gotten his real girlfriend Lisa Crosby in the film and my marriage has become a threesome. \nSensing our concern of not making it onto the silver screen Oliver tells his first assistant director to seat a \ndinner table with Susan Hess, Jill Fairchild, Prince Dimitri, Chuck Pfieffer, Grace Meigher and Mario Calvo-\nPlatero. He directs us to chat with each other turning left and right as the camera closely pans past our faces. \nElsewhere on the set are John Buffalo Mailer, as Shia's character's best friend, Austin Pendleton, 94-year-old \nEli Wallach and Natalie Morales. Also in this film are: the magnificent Frank Langella, as Shia's boss, who \nthrows himself in front of a train early in the film, Susan Sarandon as Shia's real-estate broker mother, Sylvia \nMiles, who reprises her hilarious cameo as another real-estate agent and Jean Pigozzi as an international \nbanker. \nLunch is called at 4 p.m. and Michael Douglas takes seven heavily made-up and bejeweled women including \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021238 \nSusan, Jill and me to a restaurant around the corner. Gordon Gekko hosts a hen party talking about children, \nschools, country houses and vacations. \nBack on the set Oliver is shooting the actual dinner. Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live \nmusic. Prince Dimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein, in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza, \nwatches from a table with scattered champagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86-year-old \nfather, Tulley Rector. Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and Shia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his \nhero. Carrie Mulligan, costumed like Audrey Hepburn, chats with us between takes. \nThe final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is \nclose to 9 p.m. and Lord William Astor arrives to pick me up for Amalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann's dinner \nfor artists uptown. \nOliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of \nthe shot and instructs him to tell Eli Wallach, \"We must do lunch\". Ever the proper English gentleman, \nWilliam advises Oliver that Lords do not use American slang and improvises his own lines. The tracking shot \ncontinues for numerous takes following Josh and NoeIle as every VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom \nwith one-line greetings. \nAt last, \"It's a wrap\" is screamed after 10 p.m. Prince Dimitri tells The Wall Street Journal it was, \"a day of \nelectrifying glamour,\" and \"the longest gala of my life. I was in black tie for thirteen hours.\" \nNovember 25, Tommy Gun Salon, Ludlow Street, last day of shooting \nDonald Trump is on set at 7 a.m. ready for his close up. He is trying to make a mid-day departure on his jet \nfrom Teterboro with wife Melania and son Baron for Thanksgiving weekend in Palm Beach. Back in \nSeptember, Oliver had invited Donald Trump to dinner at \"21\" to meet his leading men Josh and Shia so they \ncould observe New York's most charismatic powerbroker in his natural environment. \nThe scene is London so the grey skies are perfect. Gekko has moved abroad to make his financial \ncomeback. The scene opens on the back of his head in a barber's chair as he watches the financial news on TV. \nThe camera pulls back and Gordon Gekko is finally revealed as the powerful bull he once was in an exquisite \nsuit and signature slicked-back hair. Donald Trump walks into the shop for a cut and the banter begins about \nthe money market. From his chair, Donald leans into Michael and suggests a \"comb over\" like his famous \ndo. Gekko, with a slight grin, says, \"No thanks Donald, I am a gel man.\" \nThe crew is yucking it up and Donald feels great. Paparazzi shoot the whole scene with long lenses from across \nthe street. The unit publicist is helpless to keep this under wraps. Donald emerges, poses and gives interviews. \nMichael comes out, and the press think they have a scoop on the ending. Gekko is back in all his lovable titan \nsplendor. Full-page photos of Michael and Donald run the next day in the tabloids. Never underestimate Oliver \nStone's surprise endings. \nTwentieth Century Fox releases \"Wall Street 2: The Money Never Sleeps\" on April 23rd and it's got hit written \nall over it. \n--\n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021239 \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.

Oliver wants over the top glam, go-to-the-vault jewels and couture \ngowns. \"Give me the night before the Titanic goes down,\" were his exact words. Not a problem. \nI pay a quick visit to Michael in his trailer on Fifth Avenue where he is resting. We go way back. I was his personal publicist \nwhen he won the Golden Globe and Oscar for Best Actor for \"Wall Street\" and we have remained great friends. Gekko is just as \nchallenging for him the second time because of endless pages of technical financial dialogue. We discuss Catherine Zeta-Jones' \nBroadway debut in a \"Little Night Music.\" Michael has a stack of partially finished handwritten thank you notes next to him for gifts \nreceived for their shared birthday party on September 25th at the St. Regis. Her 40th and his 65th. \nI tell him I have been cast as an extra in two scenes and he laughs knowing I am desperate to hang around him and the \nproduction. \n8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, October 21st, another warm, stunning fall day. I report to the wardrobe trailer on 65th Street and \nMadison Avenue. I carry four elaborate cocktail dresses and bags of matching accessories. My hair is in rollers. Statuesque Julia \nKoch walks over from her Park Avenue apartment carrying her white Valentino and long diamond earrings. Her real-life financial \ntitan husband David is unaware where she is this morning. \nVanity Fair's keeper of the Best Dressed List, Amy Fine Collins, arrives totally organized in turquoise vintage Geoffrey Beene, \nand Vogue's fashion editor Hamish Bowles wears a riot of plaids, patterns and a large yellow fake flower on his lapel. Costume \nDesigner Ellen Mirojnick, who created Gordon Gekko's rich slick look in the first film, is ecstatic with the extras I invited. \nOliver is shooting a scene with Josh Brolin (the star of Stone's \"W\"). His character Bretton (never Bret) James, a ruthless Wall \nStreet kingpin, and his perfect wife Samantha (Noelle Beck) are hosting a benefit piano recital for a 13-year-old child prodigy in their \nhuge, art-filled townhouse at 41 East 65th Street. The building actually belongs to Baby Jane Holzer, a wealthy art collector still \nfamous for hanging with Andy Warhol in the '60s. The production designer had Jane's fabulous Warhols moved to storage and \nreplaced with matching photographic copies. Very expensive contemporary art is again an important production element of Oliver's \nvision. \nAt 10:30 a.m., all the extras are placed around the living room set. Oliver's French mother, Jacqueline Stone, and her friend \nMonique Van Vooren, both in their 80s, are seated in front of the fireplace chatting in French. Production assistants fuss over them. \nDebonair macho man Chuck Pfieffer, who appeared in the original film, and I immediately invent a back story—I am his corporate \nwife—and we position ourselves on a couch next to the director's mother. Julia gets the best spot close to the piano and Amy, \nHamish and decorator Geoffrey Bradfield are right behind her. Josh is brought in and the kibitzing stops. \nOliver appears on the set with eagle eyes and a sly grin and quickly re-positions everyone. He explains the scene, gives out lines \nto his favored extras, and on his way out to the monitors in the next room mentions that my earrings are too small. Wardrobe \njumps. Josh rehearses and Oliver finally yells, \"Action.\" The kid plays the piano, Josh explains why we are in his home, asks for \nmoney, the camera dollies as extras say their lines and Shia appears at the door uninvited for a confrontation with Josh. Three hours \nlater a PA yells, \"Lunch\". \nIn costume, Amy, Hamish and I run to The Monkey Bar. I am late to meet \"The Harpies,\" including Liz Smith, Barbara \nWalters, Cynthia McFadden, Nora Ephron, Jennifer Isham, Maury Perl and Beth Kseniak. \nGraydon Carter is at the next table. I tell him Oliver Stone wants him in \"Wall Street 2\" as an extra. (I make this up.) Graydon \njokes that he only works with lines. I say, \"Not a problem.\" (This will be news to Oliver.) \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021243 \nBack on the set I tell Oliver that Graydon is willing to be in the film with lines. Oliver finds that intriguing. \nOliver shoots the piano recital scene over and over again from different angles all afternoon. Financial wizard Don Marron \nsaunters on the set to visit and Oliver spontaneously puts him in a scene chatting with Josh. Carrie Mulligan hangs out watching \nboyfriend Shia work. \nAt sundown Julia Koch has to race from reel to real life and explain to her husband where she has been all day. (He loves it.) \nChuck Pfieffer plants a \"Page Six\" item and the next day socialites begin calling me to get into the film. \nThursday, November 5, Shun Lee Restaurant, West 65th Street \nOliver shoots a crowded tight interior scene with Michael, Carrie and Shia, who are having an intimate Chinese dinner. \nSpontaneously, Oliver decides this is the perfect scene for Graydon Carter. After a flurry of calls, Graydon arrives on set, and playing \nhimself, sashays by the table. Gekko jumps up to say hello and Graydon brushes him off with a few dismissive lines. \nMonday, November 9, 25 Broadway \nOne hundred swells show up at the former Canard Shipping building, a massive Italianate hall, at the crack of dawn for the \nAlzheimer's Ball, a grand charity event. \nSusan Hess and I are chauffeured downtown with our Vera Wang gowns and report to the VIP extra holding area where we join \nPrince Dimitri of Yugoslavia in a bespoke dinner jacket, journalist Christopher Mason, songstress Yanna Avis, photographer Kelly \nKlein, art dealer Larry Gagosian's girl friend Shala Monroque in see-through Rodarte, beauty executive Olivia Chantecaille, producer \nLawrence Robins, author Jackie Weld Drake, Vogue film critic Joan Juliet Buck, fashion consultant Jill Fairchild, CNN's Felicia \nTaylor and Italian newsman Mario Calvo-Platero. \nEllen Mirojnick and her costume department have assembled racks of the most expensive elaborate designer gowns and work at \nbreak neck speed styling while we wildly strip to our undies in a makeshift dressing area. Ellen pours me into a black tulle Marchesa \nwith a enormous wired silver bow. Twenty hairdressers and make-up artists systematically work on 250 extras. A mile of tables are \nalternately filled with steaming coffee, fattening breakfast foods, hair sprays, mirrors, shoes and jewelry. It's a madhouse of \nexcitement. \nWe are led to the part of the set used for the cocktail reception and placed around Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen stand-ins. \nCharlie has been flown in from LA for half a days work to reprise his original character. He is now the highest paid television actor \ncommanding two million dollars an episode of \"Two and a Half Men.\" \nOliver arrives on the set greeting, examining, tweaking the shot and always pulling the prettiest girls closest to the \ncamera. Michael and Charlie arrive from their trailers and run their lines as socials drift into their sight lines challenging their \nconcentration on pages of dialogue. Oliver yells, \"Action\" as the extras aggressively jockey for face time. Charlie is not having an \neasy day and they do take after take. My corporate husband Chuck Pfieffer has gotten his real girlfriend Lisa Crosby in the film and \nmy marriage has become a threesome. \nSensing our concern of not making it onto the silver screen Oliver tells his first assistant director to seat a dinner table with \nSusan Hess, Jill Fairchild, Prince Dimitri, Chuck Pfieffer, Grace Meigher and Mario Calvo-Platero. He directs us to chat with each \nother turning left and right as the camera closely pans past our faces. \nElsewhere on the set are John Buffalo Mailer, as Shia's character's best friend, Austin Pendleton, 94-year-old Eli Wallach and \nNatalie Morales. Also in this film are: the magnificent Frank Langella, as Shia's boss, who throws himself in front of a train early in \nthe film, Susan Sarandon as Shia's real-estate broker mother, Sylvia Miles, who reprises her hilarious cameo as another real-estate \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 021244 \nagent and Jean Pigozzi as an international banker. \nLunch is called at 4 p.m. and Michael Douglas takes seven heavily made-up and bejeweled women including Susan, Jill and me \nto a restaurant around the corner. Gordon Gekko hosts a hen party talking about children, schools, country houses and vacations. \nBack on the set Oliver is shooting the actual dinner. Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live music. Prince \nDimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein, in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza, watches from a table with scattered \nchampagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86-year-old father, Tulley Rector. Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and \nShia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his hero. Carrie Mulligan, costumed like Audrey Hepburn, chats with us between \ntakes. \nThe final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is close to 9 p.m. and \nLord William Astor arrives to pick me up for Amalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann's dinner for artists uptown. \nOliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of the shot and \ninstructs him to tell Eli Wallach, \"We must do lunch\". Ever the proper English gentleman, William advises Oliver that Lords do not \nuse American slang and improvises his own lines. The tracking shot continues for numerous takes following Josh and Noelle as \nevery VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom with one-line greetings. \nAt last, \"It's a wrap\" is screamed after 10 p.m. Prince Dimitri tells The Wall Street Journal it was, \"a day of electrifying \nglamour,\" and \"the longest gala of my life. I was in black tie for thirteen hours.\" \nNovember 25, Tommy Gun Salon, Ludlow Street, last day of shooting \nDonald Trump is on set at 7 a.m. ready for his close up. He is trying to make a mid-day departure on his jet from Teterboro \nwith wife Melania and son Baron for Thanksgiving weekend in Palm Beach. Back in September, Oliver had invited Donald Trump to \ndinner at \"21\" to meet his leading men Josh and Shia so they could observe New York's most charismatic powerbroker in his natural \nenvironment. \nThe scene is London so the grey skies are perfect. Gekko has moved abroad to make his financial comeback. The scene opens \non the back of his head in a barber's chair as he watches the financial news on TV. The camera pulls back and Gordon Gekko is \nfinally revealed as the powerful bull he once was in an exquisite suit and signature slicked-back hair. Donald Trump walks into the \nshop for a cut and the banter begins about the money market. From his chair, Donald leans into Michael and suggests a \"comb over\" \nlike his famous do. Gekko, with a slight grin, says, \"No thanks Donald, I am a gel man.\" \nThe crew is yucking it up and Donald feels great. Paparazzi shoot the whole scene with long lenses from across the street. The \nunit publicist is helpless to keep this under wraps. Donald emerges, poses and gives interviews. Michael comes out, and the press \nthink they have a scoop on the ending. Gekko is back in all his lovable titan splendor. Full-page photos of Michael and Donald run \nthe next day in the tabloids. Never underestimate Oliver Stone's surprise endings. \nTwentieth Century Fox releases \"Wall Street 2: The Money Never Sleeps\" on April 23rd and its got hit written all over it. \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
